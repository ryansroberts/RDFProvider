Adults with Type 1 diabetes should be advised that the optimal targets for short-term glycaemic control are:
? a pre-prandial blood glucose level of 4.0ï¿½7.0 mmol/l and
? a post-prandial blood glucose level of less than 9.0 mmol/l. 
Note: These values are different to those given in the recommendations for children and young people with Type 1 diabetes because of clinical differences between these two age groups.
