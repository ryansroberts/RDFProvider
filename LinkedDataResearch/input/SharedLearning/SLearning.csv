"SL01","Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes: implementation of a diabetes prevention programme","The Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes is an evidence-based person-centred diabetes prevention programme that is focused on a holistic approach to lifestyle and health. It is centred on a 3.5 hour group-based structured education programme, delivered to 8-10 participants, aimed at promoting increased physical activity and a healthy lifestyle through targeting perceptions and knowledge of diabetes and diabetes risk, self-efficacy beliefs around lifestyle change, barriers to change and self-regulation. The programme meets criteria for structured education and is specifically designed for implementation within primary care; this includes a full educator training and quality development infrastructure.","The aim of the project was to implement the Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes programme within primary care in diverse settings across the UK."," To work with a few diverse primary care organisations nationally to implement the Walking Away programme and identify and address key barriers to implementation.
- Gather detailed feedback from educators and patients at each site, through focus groups and semi-structured qualitative interviews.
- To establish the likely overall 'real world' cost of running the programme.
- To work with further primary care organisations nationally to implement the Walking Away programme once the initial phase was complete.
- To increase capacity for diabetes risk management within the context of the NHS Health Checks Programme or other local initiatives, by using risk score technology to set up systems for identifying and referring high risk individuals onto The Walking Away programme.","Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of disability and mortality nationally and exerts a huge financial cost. Over the last decade there has been a realignment of health care priorities to address this need; this has included a greater emphasis on prevention. For example, the NHS Health Checks Programme was aimed at identifying and treating vascular disease risk in all individuals between 40 and 74 years of age; the prevention of diabetes is a primary aim of the programme. Subsequently, NICE commissioned guidance on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in high risk populations. The identification of high risk individuals and referral into a lifestyle intervention are the central components of both the NHS health checks programme and the new NICE guidance. There is unequivocal evidence that physical activity in particular and a healthy lifestyle in general are of fundamental importance in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and that lifestyle intervention programmes can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 30-60%. Our group have demonstrated that around 15% of the adult population in primary care have impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose regulation, the precursors of type 2 diabetes, and that screening for and treating diabetes risk is likely to be highly cost-effective. The Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes structured education programme and associated educator training and quality assurance infrastructure was developed to address this urgent health care need. The programme was developed using gold standard methodology for complex interventions and structured education programmes and is consistent with international guidelines and best practice for diabetes prevention. Clinicians, lifestyle and behaviour change experts, representatives from local Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), policy makers and lay people all contributed to the development of the programme in order to ensure it was both effective and suitable for implementation within the NHS.","Implementation occurred in two phases. The first phase was to implement the programme in 3 diverse primary care trusts nationally. This work was then used to inform a more extensive national roll out. The initial 3 project sites in Southern, Central and Northern England identified at least 3 health care professionals with a previous experience of delivering structured education programmes to attend a two-day Walking Away residential training course designed to enable educators to become fully conversant with the content, philosophy and theory of the programme and to ensure the integrity of programme delivery. In addition, where required, training was provided for using the automated Leicester Diabetes Risk score. This risk score uses a simple evidenced-based algorithm within primary care datasets to identify those with a high risk of type 2 diabetes. Within most sites implementation is being conducted to be consistent with the NHS health checks programme, therefore the age range targeted was largely 40-75. Having been trained, educators worked within their own administrative teams to identify those with a high risk of diabetes and refer them onto the Walking Away programme. Six months after their initial training educators and other stakeholders were invited back to provide feedback on their success to date and share their experiences of running the programme. This was used to measure progress and to gain an insight into the issues faced for primary care teams delivering a diabetes prevention programme as part of usual care. Focus groups were held with participants attending the education programme to gain an insight into their perception of the programme, what key messages they took away with them and the extent the programme influenced their subsequent health behaviour. The above work was used to amend and improve the programme. The programme was then rolled out nationally to sites looking to commission an evidence-based diabetes prevention pathway.","All three sites reported moderate to high take-up rates to the programme, with two sites reporting that more than 80% of those referred to the programme attended.

Feedback from educators helped identify several key areas where the Walking Away programme curriculum could be simplified and/or improved in a primary care setting. Furthermore, the effect of institutional structure was explored. For example educators from one site in Southern England reported lower take-up rates than the other sites. This was attributed to the fact the programme was initially attempted to be run on too large a scale with no specific training given to those referring participants. In contrast, other sites started on a small scale and spent several months ensuring the programme was supported by a solid administrative infrastructure. Feedback from patients during the planned focus groups was highly positive. In particular participants thought the course was very informative and were motivated to try and modify their health behaviour through increased physical activity and the adoption of a healthy diet. A common theme was that the pedometers used in the programme were highly motivational and key to helping individuals become more physically active. However, inaccurate cheap pedometers used in some sites acted as a strong demotivating factor. Individuals reported finding the group-based environment supportive and appropriate to their needs. The automated Leicester Risk Score was found to be a highly feasible, low resource-intensive, method of identifying diabetes risk. One site, collected a detailed financial breakdown; the total projected cost to the PCT of running 72 Walking Away courses per year was estimated to be £22,720 in the first year and £19,620 thereafter (2010 costs). Given that the programme is designed to be run with between 8-10 participants, this works out at just under £40 per patient (Figures presented at the Diabetes UK annual conference, London, 2011)."," The main barrier encountered was around PCTS and teams that tried to implement the programme without adequate support and dedicated areas of responsibility among staff. It is essential to have a systematic joined-up approach to the prevention of diabetes with a clear referral framework where all individuals involved in facilitating the referral pathway have full knowledge of the programme and its importance.
- Where diabetes prevention programmes are initiated, it is important to set up the infrastructure needed within a few pilot sites generating local specific learning before the programme is implemented on a larger scale.
- Risk score technology (Leicester risk score) can effectively be used within the community and primary care to identify those with a high risk of diabetes.
- Group-based education can be used to engage individuals in the prevention of diabetes with a good take-up rate and low cost per patient.
- Pedometers appear really helpful in the promotion of physical activity, one of the most important lifestyle factors linked to the development of diabetes. However, inaccurate cheap pedometers can lead to demotivation and disengagement from the programme.
- This success has now led to the adoption of the programme in other sites nationally and internationally (Ireland). To date over 50 educators have been trained from over 8 sites with more sites planned in the future.
- This initiative was implemented prior to publication of the NICE guidance and contains useful learning points. All aspects of this intervention are not in line with what NICE recommends and users should always refer to the original guidance as the only definitive statement of the guidance"
"SL02","An innovative approach to providing lifestyle education and behaviour change to prevent type 2 diabetes","Working together the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) for Greater Manchester and NHS Salford developed a six month, telephone based, quality assured intensive lifestyle change intervention programme for people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes (high risk: those with oral glucose tolerance test result between 7.8-11mmol/l and a fasting plasma glucose result 6.1-6.9 mmol/l and diagnosed as having 'impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]'). Delivered by a team of trained health advisors, the programme provided motivation, support and evidence based education via a series of electronic scripts developed and maintained by the specialist diabetes team.","The overall aim of the initiative was to deliver a patient focused intensive lifestyle change service that would provide regular telephone support to motivate and enable people to make positive lifestyle and behaviour changes that would ultimately prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The agreed project aims between the NIHR CLAHRC for Greater Manchester, NHS Salford and the Salford Diabetes Team were:
1. To deliver a telephone based support service in which 75% of service users achieve and sustain one or more lifestyle goals
2. To deliver a telephone based support service that 75% of service users rate as assisting them in achieving one or more lifestyle goals
Measures of quantitative success were identified as:
- Clinical outcomes (pre and post programme measurement of fasting glucose and OGTT; weight, BMI and FINDRISC score [Finnish diabetes risk score])
Measures of qualitative success were identified as:
- Self reported behaviour change (goals achieved/not achieved)
- Service user feedback (focus groups, questionnaires)
- Feedback from participating GP practice staff
- Feedback from health advisors delivering the service.","Salford Diabetes Care-Call is a well established telephone based service delivered by health advisors trained in motivation interviewing techniques, primarily designed for providing education and support to people with type 2 diabetes.

Utilising the existing Care-Call, a new quality assured intensive lifestyle change service for people identified as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes was developed. New scripts and resources were designed by the specialist diabetes team specifically for this population, this included a patient information leaflet and a DVD both designed in house. A six month pathway was designed and agreed.

The objectives of the IGT Care-Call service were:
- To help people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes better understand their diagnosis and how to reduce their own risk.
- To support self care, improve general well-being and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
- To provide participants with regular telephone support to enable them to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to make positive lifestyle and behaviour changes and sustain those changes.
- Understand how to engage with and use local NHS and community services effectively.","There is overwhelming evidence from randomized control trials to show that modification of lifestyle, in particular weight and physical activity, can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. This is of particular relevance to Salford as approximately half of the 220,000 population have a recorded BMI of greater than 25 meaning they are overweight or obese.

Both the International Diabetes Federation and Diabetes UK recommend lifestyle interventions as first choice therapy for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The NHS has long shown its commitment to the prevention of diabetes in the first two standards of the Diabetes National Service Framework (2007).

Since 2007 people diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (fasting plasma glucose of 6.1-6.9 mmo/l and a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test result of between 7.8-11 mmol/l) in Salford have been invited to attend a 3 hour group lifestyle education session, delivered by the specialist diabetes team. In addition to the high costs incurred sessions may be inconvenient to the younger working population, suitable rooms were difficult to resource and increasing numbers of new patients diagnosed with diabetes placed continual demands on the specialist diabetes team.

It was decided to see if an alternative method of healthcare delivery could be developed and implemented.","The pathway commenced at the GP practice. The project identified that there was variation across the district in how registers and recall systems were set up for this population. The 7 GP practices who participated in the project were known to maintain an IGT register and had an annual recall system in place.

Following referral to Care-Call, participants received an initial introduction call from their personal health advisor to outline the IGT Care-Call programme. A 'patient pack' was sent in advance of the next 'action planning' call which included a copy of the patient's blood results. The action planning call was performed by a qualified health professional (with relevant postgraduate training e.g. Warwick Certificate in Diabetes Care; x-pert trainer) and lasted approximately 40 minutes. The aim of this call was to ensure the person understood their diagnosis and blood result, the importance of preventing type 2 diabetes and how they may be able to reduce their own risk. The patient's current lifestyle was explored with the health professional before the person set themselves an overall goal they wished to achieve over the next six months, together with a smaller specific goal (achievable in one month) on how they would embark on this. Five further calls on the pathway were made each lasting 20 minutes and delivered by the personal health advisor.

Motivational interviewing techniques were used to facilitate behaviour change and the health advisors signposted and referred patients to local services that could help with achievement of goals. On completion of the 6 month programme, repeat blood tests were performed at the GP practice and the results collected and analysed for an evaluation report. Feedback from participant focus groups identified that service users felt they would benefit from additional support after the six month programme. In response to this, the new project offers additional follow up at 9 and 12 months.","Patient demographics reflected that of the population in Salford. Patients were predominantly white and aged over 45.
An anonymised database was designed to record success in achieving goals. Key results of the IGT care-Call project demonstrated:
-52% (n=26) of patients reverted to normal fasting glucose and normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 10% (n=5) reduced their risk to impaired fasting glucose.
-75% (n=38) of patients had a confirmed weight loss on completion of the six month project, and lost an average of 4.8kg (5.3%) per person.
-Of those with an initial BMI >30, 66% (n=22) reduced BMI by an average 2.0 points per person. Seven of this group reduced to BMI 25-30 category.
-61% (N=31) reduced FINDRISC score by average 2.1 points per person. 
-88% (n=48) of patients achieved or partially achieved their overall lifestyle goal.
-91% (n=250) mini lifestyle goals (each patient has 5 mini goals) were achieved or partially achieved.
-88% (n=36) patients reported increased understanding of their blood results.
-78% (n=32) patients felt more confident about how they could reduce their own risk of developing type 2 diabetes
-90% (n=37) patients felt they received relevant up to date information on how to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Practice staff reported high confidence levels that IGT Care-Call provided evidence based, dietary and lifestyle advice and increased motivation in their patients. High levels of satisfaction with supporting patient information leaflets and resources were also reported.
The project was awarded a 'Highly commended' award in the Health Service Journal Care Integration, Diabetes Care category on 4/7/2012.

","To ensure all aspects of the project were appropriately addressed key people including trust senior management, diabetes service lead and CLAHRC programme managers.were involved from the initial planning stage. Approval was also sought from the Salford Diabetes Commissioning strategy group. The diabetes team provided essential ongoing support being responsible for writing and updating scripts and designing key resources (patient information leaflet, DVD). Using the existing service and staff to deliver this project enabled us to keep costs to a minimum.

For project evaluation purposes the FINDRISC assessment tool was used each practice nurse having an electronic version installed on their computer to record as part of the pre and post assessments. Feedback from practice nurses highlighted that this was time consuming, generated work and did not enhance service delivery as the information required for a FINDRISC was available elsewhere in the referral (e.g. weight/BMI) Using this feedback we are omitting FINDRISC in the next phase of our project.

At a time when the NHS is under considerable financial pressure, using band 4 health advisors to deliver a telephone service frees up capacity in the specialist team, and offers an effective use of resources. The Care-Call concept appears transferable and could be easily adapted to provide lifestyle advice to a wide variety of people and medical conditions.

A cost benefit analysis of the project and future expansion was favourable showing positive return on investment during year three with further (increasing) savings beyond five years. A new project which commenced in April 2012 offers the choice of two services; group education plus telephone follow up or an entirely telephone delivered service and will include people who have a diagnosis of IGT or IFG (impaired fasting glucose)."
"SL03","Establishing a Multi-disciplinary Diabetes Stakeholder Network: Early results.","The Berkshire West Federation diabetes stakeholder network (Diabetes Sans Frontières (DSF) was formed in 2012 with the aim of driving up standards of care for people with diabetes in our community. DSF was formed to ensure that care for people with diabetes is designed and delivered in the interest of the patients and their carers to achieve the best outcomes possible with the resources available. The network aims to reduce the burden of diabetes on people in our community with the disorder, to improve outcomes, and to do this whilst reducing the unit cost of care.","The Berkshire West Federation diabetes stakeholder network (Diabetes Sans Frontières (DSF) was formed in 2012 with the aim of driving up standards of care for people with diabetes in our community. This was formed from our four federated CCGs: N&W Reading, South Reading, Newbury & District, and Wokingham)
DSF network aims are to:
- Enable patients to receive the right care in the right place at the right time
- Provide a forum where all service development will be presented and agreed
- Ensure that providers give regular reports on performance to all key stakeholders, enabling service issues arising to be addressed
- Create a platform for innovation and service improvement opportunities to be debated and agree upon
- Encourage the promotion of integrated working and sponsorship
- Be a fully representative decision making body for diabetes services
- Ensure patient views are solicited and acted upon when considering service performance and developments
- Improve communication between all stakeholders and in particular, to patients and between providers.
DSF was formed to ensure that care for people with diabetes is designed and delivered in the interest of the patients and their carers to achieve the best outcomes possible with the resources available. The diabetes network board provides the forum where service developments are presented and agreed. Members give regular reports on the key performance indicators, enabling service issues arising to be addressed, creating a platform for innovation and service improvement opportunities to be debated and agreed upon.

The network strives to implement best practice, and to exceed standards of care and outcomes set down by NICE, thus moving our services into the low-cost good-outcome service category as described by the DOVE tool.

The network aims to reduce the burden of diabetes on people in our community with the disorder, to improve outcomes, and to do this whilst reducing the unit cost of care. The network also aims to reduce referral to secondary care, and the use of emergency unplanned care.

","","NICE guidelines CG87 outlines key priorities for patients to have structured education (Recommendation 1.1.1, and to achieve their individualised targets for glycaemic control, cholesterol and blood pressure Recommendation 1.3.1). People with diabetes should also have 9 key clinical processes yearly to identify risk of diabetes complications. The process that highlighted the need for change in our healthcare community was reports from the National Diabetes Audit of 2009-2010, which showed our community performance in care process and therapeutic target achievement was amongst the worst in England. These data demonstrated that the implementation of the process of diabetes care as defined by the 8 key processes of diabetes care (retinal screening excluded from 9 NICE measures in this audit) and achievement of therapeutic targets for glycaemic control, hypertension, and lipid management for the 17200 people with diabetes in our community were significantly worse than for matched communities in England. Specifically, glycaemic control was poorer for our community (46.8% vs. 56.8% achieving HbA1c<58mmol/l) and the cost of diabetes care higher at (£548 vs. £517 per person (pp) than matched communities (2009-10). (See supporting documents).

In addition to the poorer surrogate outcomes for people with diabetes in our community, information from the diabetes outcomes versus expenditure (DOVE) tool as published by the Yorkshire and Humberside public health observatory (YHPHO), demonstrated that not only were outcomes poor, but costs were high. Clearly this was an unacceptable state of affairs prompting the changes which we put into place.

There were other drivers to change. There was no accredited adult education programme in either type 1 or 2 diabetes in our community, and the provision of insulin infusion pump therapy was significantly below NICE target as demonstrated in the ABCD/DUK/JDRF insulin infusion pump therapy audit 2011-12.

However, we did have a good basis to work on in that the other measurable outcomes for people diabetes including diabetes attributable death rates and amputation rates from the community are low relative to national and matched communities.","The CCGs engaged an external consultant experienced in process management to guide us, and his help was invaluable. Key to this process was the development of the DSF network board comprising primary and secondary care physicians, healthcare commissioners, patient representatives, diabetes specialist nursing, public health, community nursing, medicines management, communications and community pharmacy - around 20 members.
To do this, the DSF network objective was to improve the skills training of all HCPs, to break down barriers between providers of diabetes care, and to set up robust treatment pathways that would ensure that appropriate care processes and therapeutic interventions occurred in a timely manner without delay.

Our key methods was introduction of:
- a community diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) service integrated with secondary care services. The DSN team now works to provide adult education, and directly to support GP practices.
- Nationally approved patient education with DAFNE for type 1 diabetes (4 courses per year) and X-pert for type 2 (60 courses per year).
- HCP education with a Diabetes Foundation course, and an advanced course in injectable therapies, PITstop.
- Care Planning as a consultation tool in primary care. Clinical metrics are collected and posted to the patients 2 weeks ahead of a collaborative consultation focussing on goal setting and action planning.
- a dedicated website for patients, carers and HCPs (www.berkshirewestdiabetes.org.uk)
- a monthly newsletter for HCPs
- a bariatric service with community-based weight loss programmes, and the provision of specialist services including bariatric surgery.
- a web-based system for benchmarking and audit (Eclipse) which enables active case finding within practices.","We have now established a community based diabetes specialist, who provides virtual diabetes clinics, visiting practices and reviewing cases with the practice HCPs, with a capacity of approximately 1500 case reviews per year. Virtual consultation by email or phone for difficult urgent cases and admission avoidance, as well as community based diabetes clinics. These changes are significantly reducing referrals to secondary care and unplanned care.
Care planning is now established in over 20% of our practices and is changing clinical care in those practices.

The web based system Eclipse is installed and 100% of practices are now enrolled. Patients are now able to look up their own records and results thought this system when registered using a smart card.

The most recent National diabetes audit shows that the proportion of people with diabetes receiving all process of diabetes care has increased significantly in those with T2DM from 33.9±2.3% (mean±SEM) (2009-10) to 56.1±1.4% (2011-12) p<0.01. The proportion of people with TIDM diabetes receiving all process of diabetes care has also increased, but from 23.8±3.2 to 42.1±1.5 although this is not statistically significant).

We have been able to control our prescribing costs. The trajectory of increasing cost of diabetes prescribing has been reversed from £294±3 (2009-10) and £313±1 (2011-12) to £283±1per person year (2012-13) (p<0.01).

It is early yet in our project, and as yet, the proportion of people achieving all targets for glycaemic, blood pressure and cholesterol management has not changed at 13.0±0.8% to 15.2±0.8% for T1DM and 20.3 ±0.4% to 20.7±0.5% for T2DM (2009-10 vs. 2011-12).

Establishment of our diabetes network is improving the process of care and is reducing costs. Our new structures make it easier to plan, introduce and monitor care for people with diabetes.","Our key learning points are:
- It is necessary for clinical leaders to fully appreciate the need for change, and the consequences of not doing so.
- Asking for help
- Early appointment of leadership for the programme with generous time provision, and the granting of 'freedom to roam' - the freedom to explore and innovate without the need to constantly refer to CCG boards
- Development of a dynamic stakeholder network to create a platform for joint decision making.
Barriers to change were remarkably few and were overcome relatively easily. There was widespread strong agreement amongst the 4 CCGs that diabetes was a key area where we were underperforming, and a realisation that it would cost us all dear - both in terms of the human cost, and financially - if we did not raise out game. The CCG Federation Chair and Long Term Conditions Chair were both strong advocates of change and fully supported the measures we have introduced. It has been very significant to have commissioning fully on board with the network, and the close collaboration between healthcare commissioners and providers has been powerful - the sense that we are truly working together to create something worthwhile.

The only really significant barrier to change is in implementation. Convincing overworked GPs and Practice Nurses to embrace and implement change is always a challenge. However, 'fast adopter' practices have welcomed many of the changes and the positive signals generated by them are being fed back to encourage other practices to follow suit. There is an expectation by the CCG boards that all practices will fully implement the changes that the stakeholder network is steering."
"SL04","Evidence-based insulin prescribing in type 2 diabetes","As part of an overall re-design of diabetes services in Northamptonshire, we reviewed the use of insulin in line with NICE CG87. The diabetes specialist nurses and a medicines management pharmacist ran (and continue to run) regular training sessions for practice nurses to provide them with the skills to initiate human isophane insulin. The savings we have consequently made on the prescribing budget have been ring-fenced and used to fund a new community-based Diabetes Multidisciplinary Team.","Our aims and objectives for the new diabetes service are to deliver a best practice care model that provides the best possible outcomes for patients. This will be through the provision of education, information, support and care so that patients can make informed choices and be able to manage their condition and will be delivered primarily via a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) in the community. The MDT will be funded through savings to the prescribing spend that will be realised by implementing the NICE CG87; the main element of our work is encouraging the use of human isophane insulin as the first-line insulin for people with type 2 diabetes.

Prior to this project, human isophane insulin accounted for only 15% of all long- and intermediate-acting insulin in Northamptonshire. This was virtually the opposite of what we would expect to see if CG87 was being followed. CG87 states, "Begin with human NPH insulin taken at bedtime or twice daily according to need" and specifies the use of analogue insulin only in certain circumstances. Our aim was to start to reverse this trend (this is also a national QIPP Medicines Management initiative) and to use the savings made to fund the MDT. The primary aims of the MDT are to:
- Improve the care for people with diabetes across Northamptonshire.
- Maintain and improve the physical and mental health of people with diabetes and hence their quality of life
- Place the emphases for Diabetes care in the county away from the treatment of complications to management of the condition where patients are empowered to work with clinicians such that they may manage their own condition effectively
- Provide care closer to home
- Provide consistent diabetes care across the county to improve quality and reduce inequities
- Minimise the impact of diabetic foot disease on the local population through a tiered, targeted integrated programme of care
- Ensure that 'hard to reach' groups and those with special needs have equal access to services.
- Reduce unnecessary admissions into secondary care
- Reduce length of stay
- Reduce number of outpatient appointments for TYPE 2 Insulin initiation
- Manage outpatient appointments within a primary / community setting following acute care
- Ensure a health economy partnership approach to the care of diabetes in Northamptonshire
- Promote a culture where clinicians learn from each other through exchange of ideas, knowledge and behaviour

","","Before the project started, human isophane insulin accounted for only 15% of all long- and intermediate-acting insulin in Northamptonshire. This was virtually the opposite of what we would expect to see if CG87 was being followed. CG87 states, "Begin with human NPH insulin taken at bedtime or twice daily according to need" and specifies the use of analogue insulin only in certain circumstances.

In addition, there was a desire amongst key stakeholders to review the overall diabetes service in the county as there was inconsistency of provision of services in different areas and a lot of dependency on secondary care.

We therefore set up a clinical reference group (CRG) which included diabetologists, diabetes specialist nurses, GPs, practice nurses, patients, podiatrists, dietitians and a pharmacist. Over a period of about 4 months the CRG designed their ideal service with the following identified as priorities:
- Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) - A community based multi-disciplinary team of clinicians will be formed. Its purpose will be to provide a link between primary and secondary care and provide more specialist care for patients outside of an acute setting. This team will include a Consultant Diabetologist, Lead Clinicians, Diabetic Specialist Nurses, Dieticians, Multi-Skilled Practitioners and Administrative Support.
- Podiatry
- Mental Health
- Patient Education
- Staff Training
- Pre-Diabetes
- Diabetes prescribing

The CRG acknowledged that there was no new money to fund this 'wish list' and they examined the current areas of spend and discussed how these could be reviewed.
Inappropriate first-line use of analogue insulin was identified as an area which was not in line with NICE guidelines and was costing an estimated extra £1million per year. The CRG agreed that this should be addressed and the consequent savings ring-fenced and used to fund the MDT.
","In order to put the insulin elements of the NICE CG87 into practice we set up a training course for practice nurses.
The one-day course is run by the diabetes specialist nurses and a medicines management pharmacist.
The pharmacist presents the evidence-base behind the NICE guideline and the nurse teaches the practical aspects of initiating human insulin.
After the training the specialist nurse mentors the practice nurses and supervises their first insulin starts.
The training explains the overall context of the project within the diabetes service re-design, explains the appropriate use of both human and analogue insulin and that the costs saved will be directly re-invested into the diabetes service.
The training does not promote switching existing patients' insulin if they are stable as we believe that this is not ethical. The training is aimed at new insulin initiations.
The training commenced in September 2010 and runs approximately every 8 weeks. The training is provided within the current staff's existing 'day job' and we use free NHS venues so the training does not incur extra costs to deliver.","When the training started in September 2010 human insulin accounted for 15% of all long- and intermediate-acting insulin. By July 2012 this had grown to 25% and had avoided over £600K of spend (NB costs in this area are not likely to actually fall due to the high increase in prevalence of type 2 diabetes; projected spend has therefore been compared with actual spend).
This money has been used to fund the MDT and the MDT has achieved:
- A 48% reduction in admissions saving £301k (comparing 2010/2011 to 2011/2012)
- Net savings based on the business case are £181k ahead of estimated savings for the year. (Estimated £608,585, actual £790,012).
- Provided mentoring and support for primary care clinicians in the treatment of diabetes to avoid un-necessary referrals.
- Integrated working in 55 primary care practices with clinics involving the range of clinicians including consultant Diabetologist.
- Provided training to 85 practice nurses to initiate human rather than analogue insulin.
- Provided equality of structured patient education across the county.
- Innovation through the use of 'diabetes specialist workers' to support 'hard to reach' patient groups
- Provided psychological support and training to patients and clinicians to identify and avoid depression and anxiety - which can lead onto complications
- Provided a quality service for patients (see appendix 1 for examples of feedback)
- Nominated for the national 'care integration awards'
- The establishment of one of the largest diabetes MDT teams in the county","The key factor has been working as part of a clinical reference group which ensured that everyone was bought into what we were trying to achieve. It was vital for the clinicians on the ground to be able to see that the money saved was ring-fenced and re-invested in diabetes services. The medicines management team had tried to address insulin prescribing in isolation a few years ago and this was not successful."
"SL05","Using a Quality Improvement Framework to make local population health gains","This incentivised quality improvement programme aimed to elevate population-based primary care provision to exemplary status. It provides direction to general practices through the use of specific aspirational targets, that complement and enhance national schemes, and tailored practice development plans. In addition to financial support, face-to-face advice, education and service development is utilised to improve quality of care across all participating practices.","The NHS Stoke on Trent Quality Improvement Framework (QIF) programme was initially designed to enhance quality of care at a local population level over a three year timeframe from 2009. The duration of the programme has since been extended for a further four years as a result of the value that has been demonstrated by this approach. The QIF programme was developed to improve the local population's health and life expectancy through the increased identification of patients with long-term conditions who were previously undiagnosed, to increase the ratio of healthcare professionals to patients and to minimise health inequality between the Stoke-on-Trent population and others in the UK and across the local population, for example by reducing exceptions of patients from high quality care. Pragmatic and achievable aspirational quality indicators were established to promote a move towards exemplary practice among local practices. These included organisational and clinical targets directed at quality 'hot spots' in patient pathways. As the aspirational standards were set to complement the QOF standards and needed to be reactive to local health needs, they have not been static. Therefore, each year the QIF standards have been revised, through 'QIF Refresh', to further refine and enhance quality attainment, and to prevent duplicate payments to practices for achievement of certain targets.","","Quality improvement within the healthcare system has been a clinical and political hot topic over recent years - in particular in relation to the capability and capacity of delivery of general medical practice care. This is evidenced by the publication and annual revisions of the NHS Outcomes Framework. Primary care is recognised as a key cog in the provision of quality health care and improving quality cannot occur without reducing unwarranted care variation and inequality within a local population and between the local population and nation. Therefore nationally it is recognised that both individual General Practitioners and their associated practices must find ways to drive positive change in quality and equal healthcare provision.

A review of the primary care strategy for NHS Stoke on Trent in 2007-8 recognised the low socioeconomic status and high levels of poor health. The model of general practice in Stoke-on-Trent was incongruous with the national picture. GP list sizes were 20% above the national average for whole time equivalent GP to patient ratio and amongst the highest in the country. About a third of practices were single handed, which was significantly above the national average, and more than 33% of GPs of an age where they might be expected to retire over the next five years. Therefore, the need to improve primary care quality was pressing. Formally pushing quality in primary care is not new. Private and publically funded 'pay-for-performance' policies have been increasingly used for over a decade; most notable was the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in 2004. Although the use of incentivised targets is contentious, some gains have been demonstrated; therefore this approach was adopted and enhanced for the delivery of the local Quality Improvement Framework (QIF).

Expected core and exemplary standards that would meet the aims and objectives of the framework were developed through consideration of the baseline level of healthcare provision and attainments of current targets, deficits inherent in the QOF targets (especially those where QOF standards were 'easier' than NICE standards), demonstrable local health need (e.g. poor lifestyle habits, low standard mortality rates, high levels of cardiovascular risk) and to align targets with current evidence based recommendations, such as those provided by NICE.","A Primary Care Development Unit was created to underpin the QIF programme. The unit set individual practice targets, recommended evidence based practice protocols for clinical management (e.g. using NICE guidance), and set attainment targets, against which practices could benchmark themselves. Examples of specific NICE guidance used within current QIF standards are: -Hypertension CG127 - practices required to have at =50% of their patients (aged < 80 years) on hypertension disease register to have at least two blood pressure readings (measured in the previous 15 months; at least 4 months apart) =140/90 mmHg -Diabetes in pregnancy CG63 - QIF requires practices to have =90% of Women with gestational diabetes (diagnosed prior to 1st April 2013) offered lifestyle advice (including weight control, diet and exercise) and fasting or random glucose measurement undertaken annually -Diabetes QS6 - QIF requires practices to have =60% of patients with diabetes to have a HbA1c measurement < 59 mmol/mol in previous 15 months; including those from minority ethnic groups -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CG101 - QIF requires at least 70% of people with COPD to have a self management plan updated annually Practices were required to meet a set of pre-qualifying criteria to join QIF. Those failing to meet the criteria were supported to improve and join QIF later in the year. Practices are rewarded financially according to attainment of the prescribed targets and receive education and tailored, face-to-face support in weaker areas to promote long-term progression towards aspirational targets. The main barriers to implementing QIF were primarily due to it representing an additional, competing priority for practices. Positive engagement was required to overcome specific barriers: - Aspirational targets were too high and unattainable short-term - steps towards targets were incentivised - Aspirational targets required more staff - an upfront payment of one third of the total available was provided to fund changes to staffing - Uncertainty of how to make it happen along patient pathways - evidence based best practice resources were developed, often largely based on NICE. Annually, the cost for QIF is £1.5m which also includes a learning and development fund to extensively support the programme. The staff supporting the scheme include a GP Clinical Lead (0.2 WTE), Practice Development and Performance Manager (1 WTE band 7) and Practice Nurse Lead (0.6 WTE band 7).","The programme has undergone annual evaluation. Most significantly, local population health reports from 2011/12 (http://www.wmpho.org.uk/publications/healthimprovement.aspx) have demonstrated a notable improvement in the population health status. Comparison of the 2008/9 Health improvement monitoring report with that from 2011/12 shows that cholesterol management (<5mmol/l) for CHD patients has seen the PCT go from being 8/17 highest PCTs in 2008/9 to 1/17 highest PCTs in 2011/12. Another example is blood pressure management (<140/85 mmHg) for CKD patients which has seen the PCT being one of the lowest of the 17 PCTs achieving this target in 2008/9 to one of the highest PCTs in 2011/12 (see supplementary evidence).

Provision of robust data about cost-savings has been hampered by variations in data collection methods and the long-term health benefits that reduction of cardiovascular risk factors has. However, the population health status, achievement of targets, patient satisfaction and use of unscheduled and outpatient care continues to be monitored annually and significant reductions in cardiovascular related morbidity and mortality is expected given the level improvement in the population's risk factors.

Pragmatic estimates tell us that with this extent of improved blood pressure control:
- If we prevented 10 less strokes in patients in a year (without taking into account social care costs / benefits / re-ablement), there would be an approximate saving of £45,000 (per year)
- If 3 less people with stage 4 CKD deteriorate to CKD stage 5 requiring dialysis in a year, there would be an approximate saving of £90,000 (per year)","A key factor in the success of this programme is perceived to be the dynamic nature of the targets used. Targets have been dynamic in a number of ways, the threshold required for payment has changed, the clinical target has been made tighter and in some cases the actual target has completely changed. This has reduced the chance of practices reaching an achievement ceiling, as has been previously identified in QOF, and constantly driving improved quality across an increasingly broad proportion of the local population.
Face-to-face intervention and support has been essential in detecting issues within general practices that may otherwise have gone unnoticed, for example, poor quality premises and poor communication skills.

A drive to improve quality even in the face of difficult decisions is necessary. The strict requirements of QIF highlighted the inadequate services provided by one general practice which, in part, led to it being closed down. Although traumatic for those involved, sometimes such drastic action is required to make a positive population health change.

Another key to success is the involvement of relevant stakeholders in the refreshment of the clinical targets. The QIF has seen extensive consultation with primary care, public health, public representatives, clinical leads and the LMC. This has led to the sustainment of the programme through minor revisions with the evolution of standards as opposed to standards that may result in major disruption in general practice."
