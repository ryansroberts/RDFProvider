In another study, an intensive five-day training course was found to be effective in reducing HbA 1c levels. In one study there was no difference in blood gl ucose control with education compared to usual care, while there were no between-group co mparisons made in another other study. Education was also shown to improve blood pressure. There is limited evidence to suggest a reduced rate of ketoacidosis and reduced hospitalisation. However, there was no evidence to indicate that education can reduce body mass index. There is some data to suggest increased incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes. Long-term outcomes of retinopathy or neuro pathy were not found to be significantly affected by education, but there is some limited evidence to suggest nephropathy incidence is improved, although rates were low. Unsurprisingly, diabetes knowledge was significantly improved with education, although this was not true of quality of life. Overall the included trials were of moderate methodological rigour.

"CG15AdultES133","The health economic searches produced no studies giving guidance on appropriate insulin re g imens for those newly-diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes or for the management and prevention of hypoglycaemia, with the exception of the NICE appraisal of insulin glargine. The health economic searches found no published papers dealing with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. A recent NICE technology appraisal 132 re co mmended insulin glargine as a long-acting preparation for people with Type 1 diabet es alongside insulin NPH. The crucial issue for the c ost-effectiveness of insulin glargine is the amount of utility associated with reducing the fear of hypoglycaemia. Tw o cost-benefit studies were identified that considered the role of insulin lispro. 342,380 Ne ither paper was based in the UK (Canada, Australia), and both suggest that the willingness to pay for insulin lispro will outweigh its additional cost. The cost-effectiveness of lispro is unclear and is likely to be most favourable amongst those who require increased flexibility in setting mealtimes, or those for whom mealtimes are often unpredictable. The issue of the cost-effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy is complicated by a shortage of unconfounded data. The DCCT showed that a series of interventions including intensive insulin therapy reduces the rate of diabetic complications and increases life expectancy amongst an unrepresentative sample of adults and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. Because of the co mplexity of this intervention, health economic analysis of the DCCT data has typically assumed that these reductions are primarily due to intensive insulin regimens. The health economic searches found three models designed to find the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment, 343–4,381 of which two attempted to form QALYs. The health utility values in each of the studies are poor: in one study 343 non-preference-based values are used; in another 381 only a very small sample was used to find health utilities. Both studies considered only a small number of health states and both suggest that intensive therapy is cost-effective.  Tw o models analysed intensive treatment in cost-per-life-year terms, and differed in their re sults. One study 343 produced a cost-per-life-year figure of US$28,661 at 1994 prices, whilst another 344 found a figure several times larger. Neither study used UK costs. Note that as several diabetic complications will affect quality of life but will not significantly shorten life expectancy, the cost-per-QALY figure may be lower than the corresponding cost-per-life-year figure. Two c ost analyses also suggest that the DCCT cost estimates may be overestimates. 345–6 Few inferences can be drawn because these studies are limited but it appears likely that intensive tr eatment, including intensive insulin regimens, will be cost-effective.","-","Health economic evidence","CG15AdultS12"

In routine practi c e, patients who go on to pumps are carefully selected, and to a large degree self-select ed.

However, there is a lack of evidence that directly compares or that statistically examines difference in intervention effectiveness between providers with different characteristics. Hence, it is not currently possible to determine the optimal characteristics of intervention providers or the scale of the impact this might have.

In the non-systematic review based on a qualitative study of UK general practitioner knowledge,

The review reported that seven trials achieving a reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes and with a follow-up of at least 12 months delivered an initial individual assessment followed by either individual or group counselling. In five out of seven of these trials, counselling was delivered mainly on an individual basis. These trials were based in the US, Finland, Japan, India and Sweden.

There is a lack of evidence that directly compares different intervention effectiveness between behavioural components, therefore it was not possible to determine the potential scale of the impact that different components may have. An analysis of intervention versus control data was conducted in one systematic review1. While it is stated that the trials included in the review use few behavioural strategies relating to the 'Theory of planned behaviour', there was a focus on behavioural intention and evidence of strategies that were common to more than one theoretical model. It was suggested that information and advice alone is insufficient to bring about lifestyle change compared to theoretically-based detailed lifestyle interventions such as those used in the major diabetes prevention trials. These include: providing information and tailoring programmes to individual needs; using multiple sessions to reinforce information; delivery to small groups or individuals; delivering written information as well as verbal advice; encouraging self-monitoring; and logging of physical activity, diet and weight change. For dietary behaviour change, taking small steps and providing both observational and vicarious
leaning opportunities as well as encouraging the identification of barriers and problem-solving were reported as strategies used in prevention programmes that had achieved reduction in diabetes incidence. For physical activity, a prescriptive approach that gradually increased the frequency and volume of activity over time as well as providing observational and vicarious learning opportunities and encouraging self-monitoring were suggested. Three of the successful trials also included direct supervision of physical activity.
Two systematic reviews2, 3 included RCTs for the prevention of diabetes (carried out in the US, UK, India, France, Finland, the Netherlands and Japan) and reported on the importance of gradually increasing volume and frequency of physical activity levels and of the importance of encouragement through direct supervision.

negatively affected by low perceived personal risk of type 2 diabetes as well as the low perceived seriousness of the condition.
Screening was generally considered to be 'good' by people at risk of type 2 diabetes who were participating in a 'stepwise' screening programme. This involved identifying the risk and then following a protocol for measuring blood glucose at set criteria – with the OGTT being the final diagnostic test if all other tests show positive. There was evidence from this study of mixed understanding of the aims of risk assessment and the meaning of the blood test results. Those with pre-diabetes tended to lack awareness of the meaning of the term and the implications of having the condition identified1.
A lack of understanding of the meaning of raised blood glucose was identified in more than two thirds of the sample in another study. Those with most understanding had family members affected by diabetes. For those without prior experience relating to diabetes, there was no personal meaning of the impact of having impaired glucose measures. Lack of understanding could also lead to acceptance of the facts being presented by practitioners without questioning them. Only one of the interviewees found the process bothersome, and two reported that time could be an issue if participants were in paid work2.","","Perceived risk and seriousness of type 2 diabetes

Practitioners' lack of awareness of available intervention tools meant that behaviour change techniques were less likely to be used than generic advice or handouts. Practitioners suggested that service-user motivation to make lifestyle changes was a barrier to implementing interventions. There was a perception among practitioners that service users may not engage in lifestyle change due to lack of motivation and commitment, lack of interest and the presence of co-morbidities1.

Participants in the focus group study spoke of the lack of public awareness of the potential impact of diabetes upon health and how diabetes can be prevented. This was compared to the higher recognition given to some other conditions such as coronary heart disease3. The interview studies reported on the uncertainty that users have about the risks and seriousness of diabetes and pre-diabetes, relating this to unhelpful advice and information from general practitioners and the media. Pre-diabetes in particular was regarded as a 'grey area' that had little meaning. There was also uncertainty in service user's understanding of the effectiveness of lifestyle change for overall health1.
This evidence is partially applicable to the UK as two studies were carried out in UK general practices.

Focus groups in the US reported that low availability of local inexpensive food choices was a barrier to making healthy dietary changes4. In terms of physical activity changes, a focus group study found that environments favouring vehicular transport over walking facilities make physical activity inaccessible4. Physical activity could also be discouraged by lack of accessibility to local facilities such as inconvenient opening times, absence of a swimming pool or a perceived lack of safety in one UK

While social occasions could present a challenge to maintaining healthy dietary changes, deviation from such practices could sometimes be accommodated, which allowed a balance to be achieved between optimal and realistic goals1.
In the Finnish survey study, the motivational effect of carrying out physical activity, such as the continuation of functional ability in later life, and generally feeling good were reported2.

Motivational interviewing, a style of counselling that encourages behaviour change, was particularly appreciated. They also found that attention to the optimal timing of information-giving allowed gradual absorption of change and therefore was a facilitator in allowing adjustment to changes1. Focus group participants in Finland found check-up visits helpful in maintaining new behaviours.
The prospect of undergoing formal measurements was a motivator to increase efforts. Similarly, interviewees in the UK reported that having repeat tests was reassuring in terms of maintaining efforts to change behaviour2.

The manufacturers did not conduct a systematic review of triple therapy for people with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with metformin and a sulfonylurea. However, they referred to a literature review of add-on therapy to metformin and sulfonylureas for type 2 diabetes produced in 2009 by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. A summary of the results of this review suggested that DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues and thiazolidinediones were associated with statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with continued therapy with metformin and sulfonylureas. No statistically significant differences in HbA1c reduction were reported between DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues and thiazolidinediones. 
Thiazolidinediones, but not DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues, were associated with statistically significant weight gain compared with metformin and sulfonylureas.

The patient cohort entered the model with a set of baseline patient characteristics and modifiable risk factors that included HbA1c, total body weight, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and systolic blood pressure. The value of these variables changed as the model simulation progressed, as a result of the effects of antidiabetic treatment and through natural progression, calculated from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS number 68) risk factor equations. The model then predicted the incidence of 7 specific macro- and microvascular events on the basis of the UKPDS 68 event risk equations. Macrovascular events predicted in the model included ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and stroke. Microvascular events included amputation, nephropathy (end-stage renal failure) and blindness. The model also calculated the probability of drug-related hypoglycaemic events (non-severe and severe), other adverse events including urinary tract infections and genital infections, and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events.","","","TA288S4"
"TA288ES3.18","Simulated patients moved through the model in 6-month cycles over a 40-year time horizon. At the start of the model, patients were assumed to have no complications associated with type 2 diabetes. At the end of the first 6-month cycle, the UKPDS risk equations determined the probability of fatal and non-fatal complications in addition to diabetes-related deaths (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and amputation) and deaths from other causes (estimated separately from UK life tables). If a patient survived beyond the first cycle, they moved to the next cycle in which they remained at risk of treatment-related adverse events and long-term macro- or microvascular events. Once a diabetes-related death or death from other causes occurred, then costs, life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were updated and the simulation ended for that patient.

For the metformin and insulin add-on analyses, the model included up to 2 additional therapy lines after dapagliflozin and the comparator. The manufacturers assumed that second-line therapy was metformin and insulin, and third-line therapy for the remainder of the patients' simulated lifetime was intensified insulin (assumed to be a 50% increase from the starting dose). For the insulin add-on analysis, second-line therapy was intensified insulin for the remainder of the simulation. For the triple therapy analysis, all comparator triple therapies were assumed to be preceded by dual therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea.

In the dapagliflozin therapy group for the add-on to metformin and insulin analyses, weight reduction was assumed to be maintained for 2 years in the model based on 2-year extension data from the trial of dapagliflozin compared with a sulfonylurea. After year 2, weight was assumed to return to its baseline value until treatment was switched in a linear trend for the dapagliflozin therapy group. After this, a natural progression in weight gain of 0.1 kg per year was assumed. Because no data were available for DPP-4 inhibitors, the same assumptions were applied.

Data on the impact on health-related quality of life of diabetes complications were taken from UKPDS (number 62) except for end-stage renal disease. In the UKPDS 62, the EQ-5D questionnaire was completed by 3667 UK patients.

The impact of end-stage renal disease on health-related quality of life was taken from the Health Outcomes Data Repository, a database of diabetic inpatients treated at Cardiff and Vale National Health Service Hospitals Trust, resulting in a loss in utility of -0.263. The impact of change in body weight on health-related quality of life was taken from a study of 100 Canadian patients with type 2 diabetes who completed a time trade-off exercise, which was commissioned by the manufacturers. Separate values were calculated for the changes in utility caused by a 1-unit decrease (+0.0171) or increase (-0.0472) in BMI.

Kendall and coworkers reported rates of approximately 30% in the first 8 weeks, compared with fewer than 10% in weeks 24–28 (Kendall et al. 2005). Zinman and coworkers had 41 reports of nausea in week 8, compared with 19 reports in week 16 (assumed to be in the exenatide with thiazolidinedione group,n = 121, calculated rates of 34% and 16% respectively). Nausea was described as mild in 44% of participants and as moderate in 40% (Zinman et al. 2007).

"TA71ES25","The most recent evidence of cost effectiveness comes from models supplied by four manufacturers and one from the Assessment Group, including an addendum. The manufacturer models show that PCIs with a BMS are cost effective compared with PCIs without stents and also compared with CABG. However, these models are relatively short-run, ranging from 6 months to 2 years. The manufacturers of the Cypher and of the Taxus stents each provided a model which examined the cost effectiveness of their own DES compared with the corresponding BMS. Each of these models showed that the DES is cost effective compared with the corresponding BMS. The Assessment Group’s model showed that the Cypher and Taxus stents, as a group, are cost effective compared with BMS.","","Cost effectiveness","TA71S02"
"TA71ES26","For patients with moderate or severe angina, PCI has been shown to be a cost-effective alternative to conventional medical treatment. Since the previous appraisal (by the
Institute in 2000) of PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents, several further studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of stents in a number of patient populations and clinical settings, including elective stenting and stenting immediately following an acute MI. 
","","PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents","TA71S02"
"TA71ES27","Comparative data on PCI using BMS versus CABG are available for only 3 years of follow-up. There are no data beyond 3 years and little data from years 2 to 3. The best available data are up to 2 years. Long-term models are needed to determine cost effectiveness because most patients who have stents fitted live longer than 5 years, and it is impossible to give a proper answer to the question of cost effectiveness by taking a short-term perspective","","CI with BMS versus CABG","TA71S02"
"TA71ES28","The Assessment Group’s model extrapolates the results to  5 years based on the currently available 3-year data. However, the extrapolation is very sensitive to the functional form chosen for the survival curve of patients who have undergone either stenting or CABG.","","CI with BMS versus CABG","TA71S02"
"TA71ES29","The benefits/disadvantages of PCIs using BMS compared with CABG, in terms of quality-of-life differences, derive from stents being a less invasive procedure on one hand but having higher rates of restenosis on the other. Neither of these two effects, in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), has been estimated to be very great, which means that if there was any appreciable difference in mortality between the two therapies, this factor would determine which of the therapies had the greater benefits. However, none of the meta-analyses from the trials shows any mortality benefit from PCI with either BMS or DES compared with CABG in the first 2 years. Hence, all the measurable benefits from using stents rather than CABG derive from an increase in the quality of life. Since stenting is considerably cheaper than CABG, under the 2-year models, it is therefore more cost effective, and indeed, dominates CABG.","","CI with BMS versus CABG","TA71S02"
"TA71ES30","The Assessment Group’s model, however, estimated a survival benefit for CABG over PCI using BMS of the order of 0.05 QALYs per patient, after the model was extrapolated to  5 years. This benefit would be enough to make CABG the preferred technology (in terms of both clinical and cost effectiveness) for patients who were candidates for both stents and CABG. The clinician consultees to the appraisal process, however, vigorously challenged this, stating that previous studies had not reached this conclusion.","","CI with BMS versus CABG","TA71S02"
"TA71ES31","The quality-of-life component of the QALY differences between BMS and DES is small, because it relates only to the extent of the differences in restenosis rates. No differences in mortality have been demonstrated. Thus, the greatest benefits of DES over BMS will occur for categories of patients for whom the absolute differences in restenosis rates are greatest.","","BMS versus DES","TA71S02"
"TA71ES32","The addendum to the Assessment Report showed that, for single-vessel disease, PCI using a DES was estimated to be cost-saving compared with PCI using a BMS at 12 months for patients with diabetes and long lesions; the estimated cost per QALY for patients without diabetes and long lesions was £15,000 and, for all patients with narrow vessels, it was £16,000. These estimates were derived from patient-level data derived from the TAXUS II trial. For the total population of patients with single-vessel disease, the cost per QALY was £94,000.

In January 2007, the Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel made recommendations to the FDA. The Panel stated, 'When the DES, which are indicated for use in the USA (SES [Cypher]) and (PES [Taxus]), are used in accordance with their approved indications both are associated with a small increase in stent thrombosis compared with BMS at 1 year after stent implantation; the increased risk of stent thrombosis was not associated with an increased risk of death or MI compared with BMS; and the concerns about thrombosis do not outweigh the benefits of DES compared with BMS when DES are implanted within the limits of their approved indications for use.' The FDA stated that a longer duration of antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial, and this has led to the recommendation in the PCI guideline of the American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association (endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography Interventions) that in patients receiving DESs the duration of clopidogrel use should be increased to 12 months. The BCIS has also recommended 12 months' use of clopidogrel in patients receiving a DES.","","Effects of DESs on the risks of thrombosis, MI and mortality","TA15201"

The Panel agreed that use of DESs 'off-label' is associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis, MI or death compared with 'on-label' use, and until more data are available DES labels (IFUs) should state that when DESs are used off-label, patient outcomes may not be the same as the results observed in the clinical trials conducted to support marketing approval. The FDA has since defined off-label use to mean the use of a medical product for treatments other than those for which the product was initially approved; or use not explicitly included in product labelling (intended use and IFU).

The FDA considers that although patients with diabetes were included in the pivotal trials, the number of patients was insufficient for either the SES (Cypher) or the PES (Taxus) to earn a specific labelled indication for people with diabetes. The UK MHRA supports the view of the FDA with regard to individuals with diabetes and only one of the DESs, the PES (Taxus), included in this appraisal has recently been specifically indicated for people with diabetes.","","Effects of DESs on the risks of thrombosis, MI and mortality","TA15201"
"TA152ES26","There were no statistically significant differences detected in death or MI between the pooled subgroups and pooled any-type DES groups. The pooled DES analysis indicated that revascularisation rates were reduced by approximately three quarters compared with BMSs, consistent across most studies of the PES (Taxus) and SESs (Cypher; Endeavor at 6–9 months). The benefits of DESs over BMSs for TLR were seen at 1 year, and this significant difference was maintained for up to 3 years. For the TVR outcome there were statistically significant differences in favour of any-type DES over BMS for most of the time points assessed.","","Summary","TA15201"
"TA152ES28","A total of 10 full economic evaluations were included in the assessment report, all of which compared an SES with a BMS, although four evaluations also included a PES. One of the evaluations was conducted in the UK; the rest were conducted in the USA, Canada or the rest of Europe. Seven evaluations used a 1-year time horizon, one used 2 years, one used 6 months and one used a patient's lifetime. Of the 10 evaluations, nine estimated that the cost of DESs incurred a price premium/difference (the difference in cost between a given BMS and the drug-eluting equivalent), which ranged from £233 to £1225. Four of the evaluations reported health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three evaluations provided incremental costs per QALY for a general population, and these costs ranged from US$27,450 to Can$96,523 (approximately US$93,000). The fourth evaluation did not include a general population because subgroups were found to be too dissimilar for comparison. Two evaluations reported the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per repeat revascularisation avoided; one estimated it to be US$1650 over 1 year and the other estimated it to be approximately US$7000 over 2 years. The majority of evaluations concluded that DESs are more cost effective than BMSs for patients with types of arteries that have a higher risk of restenosis, although there was great disparity between evaluations, with a variety of outcomes and a range of ICERs being reported.","","Published literature","TA15202"
"TA152ES29","Only one economic study, carried out alongside the BASKET RCT, reflected clinical practice because no protocol-driven angiographic follow-up was included. This study's results suggested that, at a threshold of €7800 per MACE avoided, DESs could potentially be cost effective in the following subgroups of patients: those older than 65 years; those with more than one segment treated; those with triple-vessel disease; those with a stent length of more than 20 mm; and those with small stent diameters.","","Published literature","TA15202"
"TA152ES30","Three models were submitted by DES manufacturers.","","Manufacturers' economic models","TA15202"
"TA152ES31","The decision analytic model from Boston Scientific compared the PES (Taxus) with the equivalent BMS, for a general population and for subgroups. The incremental costs per QALY at 1 year were given as £29,587 for the overall population and £1020 for patients with diabetes. For patients with small vessels and long lesions, the PES (Taxus) was dominant (both more effective and less costly than the BMS). For the PES (Taxus) at 2 years, the incremental cost per QALY for the overall population was given as £13,394, and it was dominant for patients with small vessels and those with diabetes. The model was highly sensitive to variations in the duration of clopidogrel therapy and the average number of stents used. In the manufacturer's sensitivity analyses, when the number of stents used per procedure was increased from 1.4 to 1.7, in line with the Assessment Group's model, the estimated cost per QALY at 1 year for the overall population increased to £56,731; however, the subgroup estimates were only marginally increased. If the duration of clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation was increased from 6 to 12 months, the cost per QALY at 12 months increased to £71,634 for the total population and to over £30,000 for the subgroup with diabetes.","","Manufacturers' economic models","TA15202"
"TA152ES32","The decision analytic model from Cordis compared the SES (Cypher) with the equivalent BMS for a 'no-risk-factor' population and for subgroups. The model was split into a two-way analysis of the BMS versus the SES (Cypher) and a three-way analysis of the BMS versus the PES (Taxus) versus the SES (Cypher). In extending the three-way analysis to 2 years, an indirect comparison was undertaken that made an assumption that the BMSs in both trials (Boston Scientific and Cordis BMS) are equivalent. The cost data for the technologies (the BMS and Taxus) were considered by the Assessment Group to be overestimated and when the Assessment Group re-ran the model increasing the SES (Cypher) price premium over the equivalent BMS from £433 to £695, the incremental cost per QALY increased from £29,259 to £69,613 for the 'no risk factor' subgroup; from £10,178 to £39,508 for the small-vessels subgroup; from £16,460 to £49,345 for the long-lesions subgroup; and from £9702 to £38,446 for the group with diabetes.","","Manufacturers' economic models","TA15202"
"TA152ES33","The Markov model presented by Medtronic compared the ZES (Endeavor [sirolimus analogue ABT-578]) with Medtronic's comparable BMS, for a total population. The submission measured costs and benefits at 5 years, extrapolating the 9-month trial data. In one scenario, the two arms were assumed to be equivalent in terms of risk of repeat revascularisations after 1 year. The incremental cost per QALY was estimated at £11,220. No subgroup analyses were undertaken. The Assessment Group found the model to be highly sensitive to baseline TVR rates and the number of index stents used. If baseline TVR rates were reduced below 12% (for both the BMS and the ZES), then the ICER exceeded £30,000. If the average number of stents used for the index procedure was increased to 1.4, the ICER increased to £39,174. The Assessment Group noted that the two factors to which the model was sensitive were taken from a single positive trial.","","Manufacturers' economic models","TA15202"
"TA152ES34","The submission from Kiwimed compared an SES (Yukon) with the Kiwimed BMS for a total population. The effectiveness data were taken from the SES (Cypher) trials, so an untested assumption was made that the SES (Yukon) has equivalent effectiveness to the SES (Cypher). Extrapolation from 2 to 5 years was undertaken using an assumption that patients remained in the same health state that they were in at the end of 1 year. Kiwimed's submission stated that the model results indicated that the SES (Yukon) was dominant compared with the BMS in the total population. In a sensitivity analysis varying the cost of the stent and the probability of restenosis, the ICERs for the SES (Yukon) were always under £30,000 per QALY.","","Manufacturers' economic models","TA15202"
"TA152ES35","The Assessment Group's model used the framework from the original appraisal with some minor modifications as follows: the time horizon was restricted to 1 year, so no discounting was necessary; particular risk groups were examined; in addition to the modelling of any-type DES compared with BMS, some head to head comparisons were conducted (SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus).","","Assessment Group model: methods","TA15202"
"TA152ES36","A difference between the effectiveness of DES and BMS was only seen with regard to revascularisation (TLR and TVR) and event rate (MACE and TVF). For these endpoints, the clinical trials show evidence of differences between DESs and BMSs at 1 year. The clinical trials show evidence in favour of DESs over all follow-up periods up to 3 years with a trend towards the greatest benefit occurring within the first year.","","Assessment Group model: methods","TA15202"
"TA152ES37","In the Assessment Group's model the most important factors in determining the incremental cost were the additional cost per DES implanted (price premium/difference) and the number of stents implanted per patient. The most important factors in determining benefit in the model were the absolute risk of revascularisation for patients treated with a BMS and the risk reduction attributable to the use of a DES.","","Assessment Group model: methods","TA15202"
"TA152ES38","The acquisition cost of a given stent may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts. The Assessment Group in their economic evaluation used the prices from a market survey of NHS purchasers. The survey was conducted by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency in May/June 2005 to identify the prices in contracts covering the period 2004/05 for both DESs and BMSs. The combined data from 12 purchasing bodies covering 20 hospital trusts provided consistent estimates of average unit prices and of the differences in price between DESs and BMSs. Results were provided for the two main suppliers of DESs: Boston Scientific (Taxus) and Cordis Corporation (Cypher). The effective sale price per Taxus PES (excluding VAT) was £815. Because there was only one recorded instance of a significant local volume discount agreement for Cypher in the survey, the average sample price for the Cypher SES (excluding VAT) was £937. The estimated average price for a BMS in the survey (excluding VAT) was £278, so the price differences are £537 and £659 per DES for Taxus and Cypher, respectively.","","Assessment Group model: methods","TA15202"
"TA152ES39","Based on the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, the Assessment Group's original base-case scenario as described in 4.2.20 assumes the overall repeat revascularisation rate for the total population of stented patients in the UK at 12 months after PCI with BMSs is 7.43%. Using 7.43% for all patients, the absolute rates of repeat revascularisation for the risk factors become: 7.8% for long lesions; 9.0% for diabetes; and 9.9% for small vessels. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient from the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data (1.615) and assuming a price difference of £600 (approximate average of the price difference of the PES Taxus and the SES Cypher, from the survey data) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of elective patients are approximately: £407,000 for all patients; £380,000 for long lesions; £340,000 for diabetes; and £306,000 for small vessels. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient for non-elective patients (1.467) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups, at a price difference of £600, are: £282,000 for all patients; £250,000 for long lesions; £353,000 for diabetes; and £94,000 for small vessels.","","Assessment Group model: results","TA15202"

The relative risk reduction with DESs is assumed to be 55%. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient from the Liverpool audit data, both elective and non-elective (1.571) and assuming a price difference of £600 (approximate average of the price difference of the PES [Taxus] and the SES [Cypher], from the survey data) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £213,000 for all patients; £183,000 for long lesions; £180,000 for diabetes; and £146,000 for small vessels.
