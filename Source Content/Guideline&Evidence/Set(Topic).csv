"CG15AdultS1","Diagnosis","Diagnosis","The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes would not appear to present any problems. It is, however, a lifelong condition requiring treatment with a therapy of considerable health and social impact (insulin injections) so it is important that the diagnosis is secure. Considerations also arise over differentiating the types of diabetes.","The group endorsed the commentary discussed above, and concluded that simple
recommendations were all that were required. Although in this condition diagnosis of diabetes is rarely in doubt, errors do arise in attribution of diabetes type on occasions, and this is known to result in negative consequences including failure to anticipate ketoacidosis or unnecessary insulin therapy. Accordingly the group felt that cautionary recommendations were in order. The group noted that formal evidence of the utility of tests to distinguish type of diabetes by auto-immune markers or measures of islet B-cell function was not positive, and that these tests were not routinely performed. The group were keen to reiterate the importance of laboratory glucose estimation in line with WHO recommendations to avoid the very rare misdiagnoses with lifelong consequences. The25 role of symptoms and of HbA1c estimation were seen as useful but only supportive, as both lack absolute specificity."
"CG15AdultS2","Care process and support","Optimal healthcare processes","The management of diabetes is multidimensional, and each dimension is multifaceted. Notable dimensions include diagnosis and associated management, preventative long-term care, hospital and emergency management, and detection and management of late-developing complications. With each of these dimensions a number of care areas are found (for example in long-term prevention, glucose control, blood pressure control, risk factor surveillance, blood lipid control and smoking), and for each care area a number of deliverables addressed (for example in blood glucose control: knowledge and basis of targets, injection skills, selfmonitoring, dose adjustment, dietary matching, hypoglycaemia management, sick day management) by a number of different members of a multidisciplinary team. This
multidimensional care delivery requirement has spawned diverse attempts aimed at ensuring optimal care is available to all those with diabetes. This section of the guideline seeks to examine what evidence is available to support some of these approaches.","The group endorsed the approaches suggested by the evidence, but noted that attempts to implement some of the recommendations in the past had been inhibited by funding difficulties.This however was not felt to be a barrier to reiterating the health gains to be obtained. It was noted that recent publications (beyond the cut-off date of the searches) supported some of the recommendations further, including those relating to specialist nurses. The UK’s national service framework for diabetes was noted to have endorsed diabetes registers. The group recognised the lack of any kind of formal evidence relating to walk-in, telephone-request and out-of-hours services."
"CG15AdultS3","Care process and support","Support groups","As having Type 1 diabetes can have a major impact on lifestyle and self-esteem, it would appear
that support groups could have a role in providing for some needs outside the professional
environment and even separately from immediate carers. The range of such potential input is
large and might stretch from simply fulfilling a need for belonging, through to helping with
diabetes-related financial problems (such as insurance), and even providing a further source of
diabetes-related information. Coping with diabetes, or any other condition, is influenced not only by psychological characteristics of the individual but also by social relationships (eg support and communication byhealthcare team, family and friends). Informal interpersonal variables, such as social resources and support, have been found to be associated with better diabetes self-management,56–7 family environment,58–60 and marital interaction.61  A medical condition is only one aspect that affects the make-up of an individual’s personal identity, and for some may be perceived as a minor factor compared to their environmental and social circumstances.  A ‘support group’ is defined in this guideline as a group of people with Type 1 diabetes that comes together to provide support to themselves and others in their locality. Members are usually unpaid and many will be supported under the auspices of national (or local) voluntary organisations. Support groups have become commonplace throughout health and social care. Patients and carers may choose to contact or be involved with support groups to gain information and support to benefit their own needs, or with a wider altruistic aim of helping other people within the local community. It was not possible to find specific research
identifying patient and carer preferences for support groups, or indeed to identify specific groups or types of people who may benefit more than others. Some people attend meetings of groups regularly whilst other individuals are reassured by being aware of a group’s existence and the opportunity to contact the group at a later date if problems arise and/or support is required. Preferences are dependent on what stage people are at in their lives and what information is taken (or needs to be taken) on board. ","-"
"CG15AdultS4","Care process and support","Quality audit and monitoring","It is generally accepted now that any system delivering a product, including healthcare systems, can benefit from review of its performance. The diabetes care espoused by this guideline is both co mplex and systematic, and thus lends itself to the kind of data collection needed for quality development. That very complexity, however, means that monitoring the structures, process and outcomes of all sectors can seem overwhelming, necessitating consideration of how limited monitoring activity can be undertaken without distorting the areas gaining attention for improvement. Monitoring of quality of life would seem a priori to be of particular importance in diabetes care, but presents its own difficulties of data acquisition and of analysis of te mporally different outcomes. A udit criteria are suggested in section 3.3 of this guideline to assist local users in promoting implementation and monitoring ongoing improve ments in process and outcome. They have been informed where possible by existing validated measures, principally those of the National Centre for Health Outcome Development. 75","-"
"CG15AdultS5","Education progammes and self-care","Education programmes for adults with Type 1 diabetes","Having diabetes involves acquiring a great range of new skills and knowledge, including insulin therapy, dietary changes, self-monitoring, hypoglycaemia, jobs, travel, physical exercise, coping w ith concurrent illness, foot care, arterial risk control and avoiding complications. The history of education and information giving in diabetes care goes back to the earliest dietary interventions several centuries ago, and the use of education professionals to impart skills associated with insulin therapy dates from the time of discovery and isolation of insulin. Ac co r dingly patient education is a true corner stone that enables self-management of diabetes, and most diabetes management is self-management. Review of other parts of this NICE guideline will reveal that education and information giving are parts of nearly all of them, from enabling patient choice in determining features of self-management, to acquisition of skills needed to perform tasks and make judgements, to self-care where high risk complications have developed, and to skills in handling healthcare professionals to ensure that issues of importance to the person with Type 1 diabetes are addressed.","The group noted that patient education was a necessary and logical part of most aspects of diabetes self-care, and that self-care was a social, health and economic necessity in the manage- ment of the condition. Specific recommendations related to aspects of care such as self- monitoring, insulin therapy, foot care and nutrition were thought best presented in the individual sections of this guideline. The group noted inap propriateness of the classical clinical trial model when just one feature of an integrated pac kage was varied, and one of many possible outputs monitored as primary outcome. There is also the difficulty of, and lack of funding for, the larger, longer-term trials used for pharmaceutical interventions. Equally, the central role of education in achieving success in blood glucose control and health outcomes (DCCT and other key studies) c ould not be ignored. Such information suggested that educational interventions were likely to be c ost-effective, but it was impossible to make compar ative judgements of different education models, a conclusion seemingly also reached by the NICE Appraisal Committee on the basis of a re port from the University of Southampton’s health technology assessment unit. Is sues of information overload at the stressful time of diagnosis, the size of the longer-term educational needs of individuals, the diversity of individual needs, and the retention of the information needed to make informed choices, and the group’s experience of these in practice, served to guide recommendations broadly in line with those of Diabetes UK and the International Diabetes Federation (Europe)."
"CG15AdultS6","Education progammes and self-care","Self-monitoring of blood glucose","In sulin therapy has to be adjusted with lifesty le, insulin dose requirements vary from individual to individual, and the effects of insulin injections are notoriously erratic. It might seem obvious that being able to keep an hour-to-hour or day-to-day check on actual blood glucose levels w ould be to the advantage of any person using insulin therapy. Potential should exist here to assist with diabetes self-education, dose optimisat ion, reassurance over hypoglycaemia and helping professionals give optimum advice on insulin regimens.","Self-monitoring does not, in itself, appear to improve blood glucose control. However, the gr oup noted that it was an essential component of the markedly improved blood glucose control with improved outcomes demonstrated in the landmark DCCT study, and indeed in the other smaller studies of blood glucose control and complications. Indeed it was difficult for members of the group to conceive how modern flexible insulin dosage regimens could be adopted without it. However, the technique is not easy, painless or convenient, and as a result no one system is found appropriate for use by all individuals. Improved technical facility could be identified from clinical experience. Nevertheless appropriate training and quality of skills re vi ew is agreed as necessary and normal practice. Different individuals are noted to use this te c hnology with different frequencies and for different needs according to personal preferences. Given the nature of the technology it is rarely abused. A newer approach, using smaller blood samples from non-finger-prick sites, was not judged to have adequate evidence of reliability, particularly in the situation of hypoglycaemia, to allow a general recommendation."
"CG15AdultS7","Education progammes and self-care","Dietary management","The imperfect nature of insulin replacement the ra py , and in particular the prospective, erratic and inappropriate profiles of insulin absorption, make it necessary to understand the effects of different foods on glucose excursions if these ex cursions are to be appropriately minimised. Fu r thermore, people with Type 1 diabetes are at high arterial risk, which might be ameliorated by appropriate nutritional choices, while some associated conditions can be partly managed through nutritional advice.","The group was impressed by the systematic approach to nutritional recommendations published by the ADA, 76 and the consistency of that approach with the new recommendations from Diabetes UK. 107 Co nsideration of the existing guidelines in the area did not lead the group to any divergent recommendations on nutrition. Furthermore, recent NICE guidance on education models for people with Type 1 diabet es had particularly addressed the relevance of one programme for mealtime insulin dose ad justment (DAFNE) and, after due discussion of some of the issues surrounding that study including the health economic issues, it was felt inappropriate to recommend modification of any of the appraisal’s conclusions. Accordingly the recommendations agreed by the group are mainly those of emphasis and approach appropriate to people with Type 1 diabetes, but reflecting both management of blood glucose ex cursions and arterial risk"
"CG15AdultS8","Education progammes and self-care","Physical activity","Ma ny people wish to perform varying amounts of physical exercise, but this can interact to disturb blood glucose levels in people on insulin therapy. Physical exercise is usually re co mmended to the general population as part of a package of lifestyle measures to improve future health, in particular reduction of arterial risk, which is markedly elevated in people with Ty pe 1 diabetes.","The group noted that the evidence for an improved arterial risk profile in people with Type 1 diabetes was consistent with that for other diabetic and non-diabetic people. Evidence of a co nsistent effect in improving blood glucose control was absent, although by analogy with people with Type 2 diabetes the overweight/insulin-resistant person might benefit from an ex ercise programme as part of a lifestyle improvement initiative. Some people will undertake significant exercise by choice and would benefit from support in so doing."
"CG15AdultS9","Education progammes and self-care","Cultural and individual lifestyle","C ultural and genetic differences between ethnic groups are known to affect health and response to healthcare for many diseases. In regard of Type 1 diabetes this is particularly true of eating habits, while arterial risk is known to differ for the general population and people with Type 2 diabetes. Other care issues seem likely.","The group were aware of a systematic review designed to detect issues of relevance (rather than trials of interventions) and identified papers concerning differences in incidence, attitudes to complications, degree of response to education programmes, blood glucose control, religious fasting and feasting, and hospitalisation. The group noted that cultural and genetic issues affected diabetes healthcare delivery in the areas of:
? patient education and self-care
? nutritional advice
? insulin therapy (including religious feasts and fasts)
? arterial risk
? blood pressure management
? hospitalisation. Insome areas there was overlap with social/deprivation issues. The group’s recommendations address cultural/religious issues in the appropriate sections of this guideline, emphasising the
primacy of the individual in this regard. "
"CG15AdultS10","Blood glucose control and insulin therapy","Clinical monitoring of blood glucose","Ty pe 1 diabetes is for most of the time asymptomatic once effective therapy is instituted. However, it is generally understood that there is a re lationship between blood glucose control and the late complications of the condition. Together these observations suggest that some means of monitoring blood glucose control should help healthcare professionals advise people with diabetes to best effect on insulin doses, regimens and associated lifestyle issues.","The group endorsed the utility of having a frame of reference against which people with diabetes and the professionals advising them could assess risk and risk threshold for micro- and macro-vascular disease in terms of blood glucose control. This was a core component of intensification of therapy in studies showing improved long-term outcomes. HbA 1c is the only measure for which quantitative information linking glucose control to complications is av ailable, and then only when standardised to the assay used in the DCCT study. Near patient t esting was felt to be a core component of making optimal and relevant use of HbA 1c re sults. Co ntinuous glucose monitoring systems were considered to not yet have established their usefulness beyond problem-solving in the occasional person with recurrent blood glucose co ntrol problems at the same time of day."
"CG15AdultS11","Blood glucose control and insulin therapy","Glucose control assessment levels","The DCCT, and a number of smaller studies which are potentially underpowered, 113 suggest that more intensive management of people with Type 1 diabetes (by themselves, with advice) re duces the rate of development of microvascular complications over a period of years. The primary metabolic improvement in the DCCT was lowering of blood glucose level, and this was the measure used in that study to drive the intensification of therapy. This suggests that using measures of blood glucose control in the routine management of therapy in people with Type 1 diabetes is well founded. A question then arises as to what level of blood glucose control people with diabetes should ch oose to strive for. A closely related question is what level(s) of glucose control should be used in assessing the performance of diabetes services. ‘T argets’ have been criticised by some as not giving flexibility for individuals with particular problems (eg hypoglycaemia) to be content with higher HbA 1c levels, which allows some longer-term risk for a gain in current well-being. It is clearly useful to be able to identify those in whom newer and more expensive technologies could be tried in an attempt to reduce microvascular risk, and to distinguish them from those who already achieve safe (or safer) levels on their current therapy. People with diabetes need information on what blood glucose level they need to attain if they wish to minimise vascular risk.","There must be a threshold for glucose control and the development of microvascular co mplications, or non-diabetic people would get complications. Indeed, this threshold must be we ll above the normal range as people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) do not (by definition) get microvascular complications. As people with IGT have HbA 1c levels of up to 7.0%, this by itself sets a lower limit of microvascular risk. The microvascular thresholds of HbA 1c 7.5% set around 10 years ago have stood the test of all data published since. If anything the DCCT, Krolewski and McCance data suggest a figure closer to 8.0%. Re co mmendations from the ADA (7.0%) and American College of Endocrinologists (6.5%) are not specific to type of diabetes; data does suggest macrovascular protection is gained by lowering blood glucose levels into the normal range, and the NICE (inherited) guidelines for Ty pe 2 diabetes go for HbA 1c 6.5% in these higher arterial risk individuals. Some people with Type 1 diabetes are at higher arterial risk, notably those with developing nephropathy. This can be identified by increased albumin excretion rate. The presence of features of the metabolic syndrome will also predict higher arterial risk. It may be appropriate to co nsider tighter targets for glucose control (if feasible) in people in these categories. Ho we ve r, these levels are better considered as assessment levels , to be used in setting realistic targets for the individual. Major diabetes services in Europe currently only get about 20% of people with Type 1 diabetes into the sub-7.5% bracket. UK composite data (UKDIABS) shows some services doing better, but this may only represent non-standardised GHb estimation. That current technologies of diabetes care markedly limited the proportion of people on insulin w ho were able to manage themselves to ideal levels was not seen as a bar to setting such assessment levels. It was noted that arterial risk would be likely to have a different relationship in this regard from microvascular risk, and that for the former there was little direct information available for people with Type 1 diabetes, but that the understandings gained in Ty pe 2 diabetes and people without diabetes gave strong guidance in this respect. It was felt that as the assessment of the evidence available pointed to target definition in the same range as other published guidelines, and in particular the NICE inherited guidelines for Type 2 diabetes, there was practical utility for practice of care in having matching recommendations. Lastly the problem of hypoglycaemia in limiting was what achievable in any individual should be addressed within any recommendations, to assuage inappropriate attempts to achieve tight co ntrol and counter impressions of failure if targets are not attained."
"CG15AdultS12","Blood glucose control and insulin therapy","Insulin regimens","Ty pe 1 diabetes is an insulin deficiency disease. Physiological insulin delivery is regulated on a minute-to-minute basis, while therapeutic insulin is given a small number of times a day. Fu r thermore subcutaneous depot insulin preparations have, until recently, not come close to providing the physiological plasma insulin profiles occurring at mealtimes or in the inter- prandial basal state. A number of preparations of mealtime and extended-acting insulins are av ailable, and combining these to suit individual needs, while taking account of preferences for n umbers of injections, gives a variety of possib le insulin regimens of differing characteristics. W hile insulin deficiency is the hallmark of Type 1 diabetes, a few people retain some insulin secretion for a short time (and might therefo re benefit from insulin secretagogues). Some gl ucose-lowering drugs work on gut absorption of nutrients or on the insulin effector tissues, and might therefore be expected to be of benefit in some individuals even when completely insulin deficient and managed on insulin replacement therapy.","It was noted that Type 1 diabetes is a hormone deficiency disease. The problems faced by people w ith the condition (injections, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, consequences of capricious co ntrol, late complications) were noted to be solely a function of the poor state of insulin re placement therapy. The group noted that the use of insulin injections in people with Type 1 diabetes is not RCT- based and never could be. It was also noted that, prior to the introduction of short- and long- acting insulin analogues, the use of insulin regimens based on a combination in various forms of unmodified (soluble) human insulin befo re meals and human isophane (NPH) insulin for basal supply had become widespread, and that, the analogues aside, there was no evidence to ch allenge that conventional practice. Long-acting analogues, or rather insulin glargine, are co ve re d by NICE appraisal guidance, and this recommends their availability for use in people w ith Type 1 diabetes. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are supported by an evidence base for less hy poglycaemia at night and at some other times, reduced hyperglycaemic excursions after meals and small improvements in HbA 1c , suggesting that these too should have an increasing r ole in people with Type 1 diabetes. The group was aware that the evidence for combining the advantages of rapid- and long-acting insulin analogues was evolving as the knowledge base to use these technologies improves. This co mbination would be particularly suitable to matching with active mealtime insulin dose adjustment (AMIDA, see dietary recommendations in 6.3). Some recent NICE technology appraisals provided a health economic basis for supporting this regimen, should appropriate improvements in HbA 1c be demonstrated. Accordingly the recommendations were drafted to allow choice of human or combined analogue regimens including from the time of diagnosis. The group noted the potential usefulness of the new insulins in some special situations, including religious feasts and fasts, and shift work. A need to address insulin starters and people who wished for smaller numbers of injections was identified. A need to caution against using newer, more expensive insulins in people with control problems without proper assessment of underlying causes was felt appropriate. The NICE appraisal of insulin pumps (effectively an insulin regimen rather than a device) was noted, and no elaboration felt to be needed on that. The group found the evidence for the general recommendation of any glucose-lowering drug in combination with insulin to be unconvincing. While there may be a small gain in overall gl ucose control evidenced inconsistently in the acarbose studies, the size of this gain, the prevalence of intolerance, and the suggestion of increased hypoglycaemia, together were taken as indicating that no recommendation for the general use of this drug in this context could be made.  The use of metformin and insulin sensitisers in people with Type 1 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome has not been adequately investigated. The group was aware of the concern that arterial complications in people with Type 1 diabetes we re associated with features of the metabolic syndrome as seen in Type 2 diabetes, and that there was evidence of benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes for some drugs, notably metformin (UKPDS study) and PPAR- ? agonists (see NICE guidance). While not endorsing the general use of such drugs in people with Type 1 diabetes and features of the metabolic syndrome (see section 8.2, ‘Arterial disease management’), the group noted that further investigation might support the high a priori likelihood of benefit in this high-risk situation."
"CG15AdultS13","Blood glucose control and insulin therapy","Insulin delivery","As a large protein, insulin cannot be taken orally (it is digested) and is only absorbed across mu c ous membranes (of the nose or inside cheeks for example) very poorly. As a result, it generally has to be injected or infused into the subcutaneous fat. Self-use of injection devices is not something most people adopt happily by choice, and since the late 1970s various solutions to making this easier and more satisfactory have been developed. ","In sulin injection pens were noted to be the overwhelming norm in the UK for insulin delivery for reasons of convenience, ease of teaching and portability. Some devices with particular design characteristics can be used by people with disabilities, where otherwise a third party w ould have to give injections. The desirability and often cost-effectiveness of this was noted. In jection into deep subcutaneous fat, and on the basis of many studies into the tissues of the abdominal wall for mealtime unmodified human insulin, are generally advised and logically based. However the needs and beliefs of individuals in giving their own insulin were felt to be of importance. Simple logic also leads to the conclusion that rotation of injection sites should be within one region rather than between regions. Group members (both clinicians and people w ith diabetes) expressed a widespread experience of repeated self-injection with the same needle without problems arising. The group considered the utility of recommending advice on cleanliness for those who choose to re-use needles, but noted the regulatory position from the Me dicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, formerly the Medical Devices Ag ency) in the bulletin DB2000(04). Consequently, the guideline cannot make such a re co mmendation. Other common sense issues included provision for sharps disposal, and ch eck on the condition of injection sites annually or if blood glucose control problems worsen."
"CG15AdultS14","Blood glucose control and insulin therapy","Hypoglycaemia: prevention of hypoglycaemia, problems related to
hypoglycaemia and management of symptomatic hypoglycaemia","Hy poglycaemia is, for most people using insulin therapy, an inevitable consequence of the erratic absorption of insulin from subcutaneous tissue after depot injection or infusion, c oupled with absence of feedback to insulin need when changes in planned activity or eating occur once the injection has been given. Hypoglycaemia is usually unpleasant, often becomes a source of fear, and can be an embarrassment as well as a safety risk. Accordingly, while careful ch oice of insulin regimen (section 7.3) informed by self-monitoring (section 6.2) is important in ameliorating this problem, other preventative measures are of importance. A higher level of optimised management is needed when hypoglycaemia and its related problems do occur.","The group noted this was an area of considerable importance to people with Type 1 diabetes, but that prevention of hypoglycaemia was considered appropriately under insulin therapy re co mmendations, and secondarily under education and lifestyle issues. The group noted issues re lated to absorption and ingestion of free carbohydrate in people with decreased conscious level. They were concerned that recurrent hypoglycaemia was properly considered in a medical co ntext, and not simply attributed to lifestyle problems secondary to insulin therapy. Hy poglycaemia unawareness was also noted to be an important issue, and be partially reversible and capable of useful management, as now is nocturnal hypoglycaemia (it was noted that the re co mmendations on insulin therapy and clinical monitoring addressed other aspects of such management). No useful hard evidence was available for cognitive decline occurring in people w ith Type 1 diabetes, but the possibility of recurrent severe hypoglycaemia being a contributory factor was felt worth mentioning. The group noted that the ease and safety of administration of glucagon compared to IV glucose (risk of extravasation) meant that in most situations it was the treatment of choice. While it was re co g nised that there were groups of people to whom the identified studies do not apply (starvation, alcohol toxic), and that these people would not be expected to respond well to gl ucagon, it was agreed that the best means of detecting this was by absence of a response to gl ucagon at 10 minutes. Safe follow-up management after either therapy should include oral carbohydrate and awareness of risk of relapse. Users of glucagon injections need appropriate education and training."
"CG15AdultS15","Arterial risk control","Identification of arterial risk","People with Type 1 diabetes are generally recognised to be at greatly increased risk of arterial disease (CVD) in middle age. While the literature on arterial risk factors and markers in the general population is large, it would not appear to follow that the findings can be simply carried ov er to people with Type 1 diabetes. Similarly, the tools used to quantify arterial risk in the general population are known not to work well in people with Type 2 diabetes, and seem even less likely to be valid in Type 1 diabetes.","The group recognised the very considerable difficulties in reaching conclusions from the ev idence in this area. Very little direct information pertaining to people with Type 1 diabetes can be ascertained, whilst the importance of the issue is emphasised by the very high early arterial disease (CVD) risk run by people with Type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless certain sub-groups are known to be at particularly high risk (people with raised albumin excretion rate (micro- albuminuria)), while others combine Type 1 diabetes with combinations of classic risk factors ty pical of the metabolic syndrome and known to be predictors of high arterial risk in people w ith Type 2 diabetes and indeed non-diabetic po pulations. A further group of people will co mbine Type 1 diabetes with a single arterial risk factor or risk marker, while yet others will have Type 1 diabetes but appear low risk otherwise. Ac co r dingly the important factors for surveillance are urinary albumin excretion (most important), other classical risk factors including full lipid profile, and risk markers such as age, family history and some ethnic groups. In accordance with the principle of unified organisation of care, monitoring of these factors annually is to be recommended, but it was recognised that in low risk individuals technology might become capable of programming longer review intervals for serum lipids. The group recognised that different ways of using information from a full lipid profile (calculated LDL and HDL separately, calculation of total: HDL cholesterol ratio, calculation of non-HDL cholesterol) are in use. While the group preferred the first of these as not mixing lipid abnormalities of different pathogenesis, and being a better route to using the treatments for different lipid disorders rationally, it was recog nised that there was not good evidence to suggest supporting one approach over the others. The group could find no confidence in any risk table, engine or equation when applied to people with Type 1 diabetes."
"CG15AdultS16","Arterial risk control","Interventions to reduce risk and to manage arterial disease","Prevention of arterial risk in people with Type 1 diabetes, through attention to blood glucose co ntrol (insulin therapy, patient education, nutrit ion, self-monitoring) is considered elsewhere in this guideline, and blood pressure management in 8.3, below. However, in the general population (at much lower risk) and in people with Type 2 diabetes other therapies are known to re duce the risk of arterial events. The current section therefore deals with these approaches as applied to people with Type 1 diabetes.","The data on arterial risk management in people with Type 1 diabetes are few, though it is noted that studies in people with and without Type 2 diabetes point to clinically effective interventions for those groups. In the absence of quantitative risk assessment and noting the economic evidence placed before the group it seemed clear that interventions in people with Ty pe 1 diabetes must be recommended considering their semi-quantitative arterial disease risk: high, moderate or no risk. Given the high arterial risk of many people with Type 1 diabetes, smoking was considered to be particularly disadvantageous."

"CG10S1","Foot care: general management approach","Foot care: general management approach","Shared care has been defined as “the joint participation of hospital consultants and general  practitioners in the planned delivery of care for patients with a chronic condition, informed by  enhanced information exchange over and above routine discharge and referral notices” (Hickman et  al, 1994). Studies of the consequences of organising care have used several models: e.g. devolving  care of certain patients to primary care until a problem occurs, or retaining annual visits to a  hospital clinic with interim care in general practice. Details of the workings of a number of shared care schemes in the UK have been reviewed (Greenhalgh, 1994). 
","No evidence was found to specify the precise components, or method of transmission, of information, but the guideline development group felt it was good practice when organising services to give careful consideration to communication between primary care and specialist services. A multi-disciplinary group was set up, under the aegis of the British Diabetic Association, to report on the implementation of the St Vincent Declaration guidelines with respect to diabetic feet (Edmonds et al, 1996). Among its recommendations was specific consideration of the role of co-ordinated multi-disciplinary teams in providing care. This detailed the respective roles of the chiropodist, diabetologist, general practitioner, nurse, orthotist, radiologist and surgeon arranged variously in hospital, community care and vascular service teams. There isno formal comparative evidence to indicate if any optimal arrangement of health care professionals in the care of diabetic feet exists. However, the guideline development group felt it is good practice to ensure that a multi disciplinary team of professionals are available and co-ordinated to promptly provide the full range of appropriate services to patients."
"CG10S2","Foot care: general management approach","Patient Education","Educational strategies seek to address the perception that whilst relatively simple actions by the 
patient and physician may minimise foot complications, often these simple procedures are not 
systematically applied. This may happen because patients are unaware, are embarrassed or do not 
understand the importance of basic care. It may be because specialist services (in foot care: 
podiatry, orthotics or orthopaedics) are unavailable or have long waiting lists. Finally, the health 
care system may not be organised in such a way that regular examination by, and education from, 
health care professionals does occur (Cohen, 1983). Recent studies are a response to evidence from 
surveys which suggest that people with diabetes may not have sufficient skills or knowledge to 
properly manage the disease (Thomson et al, 1992; Masson et al, 1989; Collier, 1971). The 
common elements of patient education are foot hygiene, awareness of fungal infections, and actions 
required for cutaneous injuries.","The available studies provide inconsistent messages about the value of education and interpretation is weakened by small studies, different endpoints used by different investigators, and lack of a  common approach. Only two of the larger studies reported serious lesions as endpoints. One  indicated that where patients agree behavioural contracts and receive periodic reminders then foot  ulcers could be prevented over 1 year (Litzelman et al 1993). Another study, spacing nine  educational sessions over 18 months and using a range of teaching media, found no significant  change, (Bloomgarden et al, 1987). A further factor complicating interpretation is that patients  enrolled in studies may be at certain phases in disease processes making their clinical values atypical. Consequently both treatment and control groups may show considerable improvement 
over the period of follow-up (regression to the mean) making analyses of findings more complex. 
Intensive, prompted education requiring action from both patients and clinicians may reduce foot 
complications over relatively short-term periods of time although the evidence is inconclusive 
concerning the best method. Available trials of education feature inadequate follow-up to assess the 
potential for primary care prevention of foot complications. The value of education interventions in 
the longer term is unknown and it is likely that important messages and habits will need reinforcing 
periodically in patients and health professionals. Better foot care awareness in patients and health 
professionals will be worthwhile if it increases the likelihood of early detection and appropriate 
response to factors raising the likelihood of ulceration. 
The guideline development group also considered the issues of what key points/topics should be 
covered in patient education, particularly from the viewpoint of what would people with diabetes 
need to know about in relation to foot care. Whilst recognising that that it was not possible to give 
definitive answers in this area, they have produced a framework of key points that might provide a 
useful starting point. This was developed from a consensus of the guideline development group 
rather than from research literature, as this is not available This framework is presented in Appendix 
26. 
"
"CG10S3","Foot examination and monitoring 
","Foot examination and monitoring ","Fundamental foot care in people with diabetes involves adequate monitoring and the opportunity to reinforce messages of self-care (Boulton et al, 1998). Many people with diabetes are unable to 
perform this monitoring because of poor eyesight and reduced mobility, making it difficult to inspect their feet (Thomson et al, 1992; Masson et al, 1989), thus regular contact between professionals and patients is important (Edmonds et al, 1996). Regular foot inspection by a health care professional should include visual inspection of the legs, dorsal, plantar and posterior surfaces of the foot and between the toes. Vascular examinations involve palpation of the pulses in the lower extremities and inspection of the feet and legs for evidence of ischaemic changes. Musculoskeletal evaluation includes foot and ankle range of motion inspection for bone abnormalities and analysis of gait and stance. Neurological examinations may include tests for vibration by a biothesiometer, tuning fork (only calibrated tuning forks should be used), or cutaneous pressure sensation using a 10 gram monofilament. The ability to identify feet at risk of ulceration has been demonstrated prospectively in studies.","No direct evidence was found to identify the optimal content or frequency of visual inspections and examinations, but regular surveillance at a minimum frequency of once annually was held by the guideline development group to be good clinical practice where no complications have previously  been found. The benefits of monitoring people with diabetes without foot complications arise from  the ability to detect feet at raised risk and the reduced morbidity achieved by aggressive  intervention. Hence primary and secondary care should work together to identify a package of care  for patients at raised risk of ulceration. 
Adequate glycaemic control has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence and progression of  microvascular disease in Type 1 (insulin dependent diabetes) patients (Diabetes Control and  Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; Reichard et al, 1993). Direct evidence that improved  glucose control will equally benefit Type 2 diabetes patients (for whom macrovascular, rather than  microvascular, complications are of greater relative importance) is inadequate. A review of  available epidemiological and trial evidence suggested a trend towards greater neuropathy with poor  glycaemic control but the evidence is far from conclusive (Gaster et al, 1998). The UK Prospective  Diabetes Study, which reported in 1998, discussed the impact of differing levels of glycaemic and  blood pressure control in terms of macro and micro vascular disease but did not report specific outcomes concerning diabetic foot ulcers.

"CG10S4","Risk factors 
","Risk factors ","Epidemiological and clinical risk factors for ulceration have been extensively but inconclusively researched. 
","The guideline development group felt it was important that specific consideration should be given 
to organising care to ensure adequate supervision of these patients with risk factors although there is 
no available evidence concerning the most appropriate process"

","Footwear of patients at risk of ulceration 
","As a consequence of diabetic disease processes, notably neuropathy, changes in foot posture may 
lead to abnormal weight bearing. Plantar callus, a risk factor for ulceration, indicates abnormal foot pressures and occurs most frequently under the metatarsal heads. Specially designed insoles (or orthoses) as inserts to patients’ shoes or in combination with specially designed shoes have been proposed as a method of reducing abnormal foot pressures and thus foot ulcers. 
","This remains a research issue, where ‘optimised’ normal shoes could be usefully compared with  special therapeutic shoes. Without consideration of this pragmatic alternative and confirmatory  studies on larger patient numbers, the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of providing  therapeutic shoes remains uncertain. None the less, the guideline development group agreed that  ongoing surveillance of footwear was important."
"CG10S8","Caring for people with foot ulcers 
","Caring for people with foot ulcers 
","The morbidity associated with diabetic foot ulcers is considerable. Apelqvist and Agardh (1992) 
report a prospective study of 314 consecutive patients with diabetes with foot ulcers referred to a 
multi-disciplinary foot team in a university hospital. Healing was affected in 62% of patients, 
amputation in 25% of patients, and 13% of patients died with unhealed ulcers. The traditional 
(although inadequately evaluated) approach to diabetic foot ulcers includes debridement, and 
antibiotic treatment. In addition, new treatments include the proposed use of hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy, growth factors, ketanserin, cultured human dermis and total contact casting. 
","The guideline development group also felt that good overall glycaemic control was likely to assist wound healing in people with diabetic foot ulcers. 
"
"CG10S9","Antibiotic treatment for diabetic foot complications 
","Antibiotic treatment for diabetic foot complications 
","Polymicrobial, mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections are common in diabetic foot wounds, suggesting 
the use of antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity and low rate of toxic reactions in patients 
with diabetes who are often nephrologically impaired. Trials generally differentiate between 
infections uncomplicated by deep soft tissue involvement and ulcers which have become colonised 
by invasive penetrating infection (cellulitis), or where osteomyelitis is present. Only 4 randomised 
trials have assessed the efficacy of antibiotic therapy specifically in patients with diabetes with 
infected ulcers (for details see Appendix 7), although a number of other studies have addressed 
broader groups of patients. Two of the 4 trials addressed the treatment of non-limb threatening 
infection, 1 addressed non-limb-threatening but treatment-resistant infection, and 1 concerned 
treatment of invasive infection (cellulitis or osteomyelitis). An ongoing trial may provide more 
substantive evidence about the role of antibiotic treatments in foot ulcer care. 
","Intravenous antibiotics were agreed by the guideline development group to be appropriate care in patients with cellulitis, although adequate evidence from placebo-controlled or comparative trials is  lacking. 
"
"CG10S10","Dressings and topical agents for foot ulcers","Dressings and topical agents for foot ulcers","In many cases, foot ulcers in people with diabetes are not infected and protective bandaging is appropriate. A number of characteristics for a good dressing have been proposed (Foster et al, 1994). It should perform well in the closed environment of the shoe; not take up too much space; be capable of absorbing large quantities of exudate without plugging the wound and preventing drainage; withstand the pressures and shear forces of walking without failing; not cause side effects; and be easily lifted or removed for regular inspection without adversely affecting the wound. Whilst simple gauze dressings are often employed by clinicians, there are newer forms of dressing available. Alginate, foam, hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings have been designed to absorb 
wound exudate and control the level of wound hydration. 
An ongoing HTA multicentre trial, which is due to report in about 3 years time, may provide more 
information about the role that different dressings have in the care of foot ulcers. NICE guidelines 
on wound care management are also being developed and may be of use in this area of care (see 
Appendix 23","Trials comparing newer dressing or gels with gauze dressing cannot provide clear messages because of their small size and lack of common method. Polymeric membrane dressing, GHK-Cu complex dressing, lyophilised collagen dressing, and proprietary moist dressing suggests improved performance over gauze, but, in each case, one small trial does not provide an adequate evidence base. The findings of dimethylsulfoxide foot-bathing and topical phenytoin powder are similarly problematic and these were not randomised. The lack of efficacy of cadexomer iodine ointment, calcium alginate dressing, and collagen-alginate dressing is inconclusive. The stated importance of the newer dressings and the inappropriateness of gauze (see for example Appendix 8 and the British National Formulary) does not appear substantiated by the available evidence from randomised controlled trials. Although the available evidence from trials is inadequate, the guideline development group felt it was good practice to ensure that appropriate wound monitoring practices were observed, including close monitoring and regular dressing changes."
"CG10S11","Debridement 
","Debridement 
","Debridement is the removal of necrotic (dead) tissue by either surgical, chemical or other (eg larval  therapy) means. Types of debridement include:   autolytic debridement: this occurs naturally in healthy, moist wounds when arterial  perfusion and venous drainage are maintained  ? enzymatic debridement: using topical, proteolytic enzymes  mechanical debridement: includes, wet to dry dressings and high pressure irrigation  sharp (surgical) debridement: usually using a scalpel but may also involve tissue nippers, and/or curettes Saap and Falanga (2002) developed a Debridement Performance Index to assess the adequacy and performance of any surgical debridement undertaken. The Index was shown to be an independent predictor of wound closure (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-5.6) making it potentially a useful predictive tool for determining ulcer healing outcome following debridement. 
","A recent systematic review (Smith 2002) looked at the effectiveness of debridement as a treatment for diabetic foot ulcers in Type 1 or Type 2 patients. Of the five randomised controlled trials included in this review, all published between 1997 and 2000, none of the earlier ones had been included in the original foot care guideline evidence (Hutchinson et al 2000). Three of the studies assessed the effectiveness of a hydrogel as a debridement agent, one considered surgical debridement and the final one evaluated larval therapy. Sample sizes were predominantly small (<22 per group in three studies, approximately 70 per group in the other two studies) with a full description of age, sex and type of diabetes provided by a single study only. From a meta-analysis of the three hydrogel studies, the absolute risk difference was 0.23,95%CI 0.10, 0.36) with hydrogel being more effective than gauze or standard care in healing diabetic foot ulcers. Surgical debridement and larval therapy showed no significant benefit, but both trials were small. 
"
"CG10S12","Off-loading 
","Off-loading ","Pressure is a causal factor for neuropathic foot ulcers. Therefore removal or relief from pressure should facilitate healing of foot ulcers. The removal of pressure on affected feet or joints can be achieved by avoidance of weight bearing, known as off-loading. However, achieving effective off-loading of pressure on the foot while the patient remains ambulant remains a challenge. One way of addressing the problem is the use of therapeutic shoes.","Although there is reasonable data about the effectiveness of total contact casting, for individuals with severe ischaemia the friction that may be caused by the wearing of a cast may in itself cause injury in terms of skin breaks and thus this must also be considered when decisions are being taken about total contact cast use."

osteoarthropathy 
","Care of people with Charcot 
osteoarthropathy 
","Charcot osteoarthropathy is a progressive condition. It is characterised by dislocation of joints, 
fractures and destruction of the bony architecture. It is associated with severe peripheral 
neuropathy. In people with severe diabetic neuropathy the osseous breakdown, in most cases, is 
localised to the midfoot, with risk of collapse of the pedal arch. The acute swelling and the later 
deformity associated with this are major risk factors for ulceration and subsequently amputation. 
Such patients also have decreased bone mineral density compared with those without diabetes of a 
similar age and sex (Childs et al 1998). It is thought that bony trauma in a severely neuropathic 
limb may be a trigger for the development of Charcot osteoarthropathy. Continued walking 
promotes progression of the osteoarthropathy and worsening of the deformity. 
","From the literature three studies only were identified that described interventions for the treatment or management of Charcot’s neuroarthropathy. Two of these three were randomised double blind trials (Chantelau and Schnabel 1997, Jude et al 2001) and both were concerned with healing of the condition using outcomes such as loss of swelling and redness (Chantelau and Schnabel 1997) or reduction in foot temperature or foot pain (Jude et al 2001). The treatment approaches in the two groups differed totally. Chantelau and Schnabel administered radiotherapy whilst Jude et al delivered a single infusion of pamidronate, a biophosphate. Given the incidence of this condition, Chantelau and Schnabel took three years to recruit their 12 patients, whilst Jude et al used four centres in the UK to recruit 39 patients. The impact of both of these treatments on defined outcome compared with their placebo alternative was not significant with one exception. Symptom scores, based on an aggregation of patient assessed pain, discomfort and swelling fell in both the treatment and placebo groups within the first three months, but then continued to fall in the treatment group over the next nine months (p<0.01) giving a significant area under the symptom score curve difference (treatment group 14.3±8.7, placebo group 23.8±8.4, p=0.01) (Jude et al 2001). The other paper was a retrospective review of treatment for a cohort of patients with Charcot’s neuroarthropathy. Armsrong et al (1997) treated their 55 patients with total contact casting, the frequency of changing being based upon ulcer status. Casting was replaced by removable cast walkers and ultimately by prescription footwear on the basis of clinical, radiographic and dermal thermometric signs of quiescence of the condition, with none of these terms being clearly defined. All patients were casted for 18.5 ±10.6 weeks (range 4-56 weeks) and progression to prescription footwear took 28.3 ±14.5 weeks"

"PH38S3","Risk Identification","Risk identification (stage 1)","Identifying and assessing people at risk of, or with existing (but undiagnosed), diabetes is part of
an integrated approach to preventing vascular diseases through the NHS Health Check
programme.","Risk-assessment tools, based on the presence or absence of various risk factors, are used to identify people at high risk of type 2 diabetes among European populations. There are two broad approaches. Either they use the data routinely available in UK general practice computer databases (such as age, gender, body mass index [BMI] and family history of diabetes). Or they comprise self-assessment questionnaires which are completed manually or online. Examples of the former are the Cambridge diabetes risk score, the QDiabetes risk calculator and the Leicester practice score. Examples of the latter are the Diabetes Risk Score assessment tool (available to health professionals on the Diabetes UK website), the online Diabetes Risk Score and FINDRISC. The Diabetes Risk Score was developed and validated in Leicester for identifying those at high risk of impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes in multi-ethnic populations in the UK. It is, in turn, based on FINDRISC, a Finnish self-assessment questionnaire. FINDRISC is based on robust data and has been validated as a risk-assessment tool in cross-sectional studies and, prospectively, in other European populations. The PDG focused on risk-assessment tools validated for use in the UK and which help identify people from different ethnic groups who are at high risk of diabetes. It debated the difference between tools measuring current risk (for example, FINDRISC and scores based on it) and prospective risk (for example, QDiabetes risk calculator). This included their use of cross-sectional or prospective cohort data. Both approaches were acknowledged to have limitations. The PDG felt it was important that the tools were validated against blood glucose measures. Equally important was the need to have a range of tools available that are suitable for use in any environment where risk assessment could take place. The PDG concurred that the choice of tool is likely to depend on the population being assessed, whether it has been validated for use with that population, the risk-assessment setting and supporting infrastructure (such as compatibility with IT systems).

The PDG acknowledged that the records would need to be up-to-date and complete to ensure the tools are accurate. The tools allow staff to estimate the percentage of the practice population that is likely to fall into each risk category, and to systematically invite those with a high risk score for further investigation. For example, the top 50% of patients might be designated as high risk and then be invited for a blood test. The remainder can then be divided up accordingly into groups with a low risk score (for example, the lowest quartile who will receive brief advice) and those with an intermediate risk score (who may need more advice about managing their risk).

Waist measurement is not routinely recorded by risk-assessment tools and it is not taken into account by the NHS Health Check programme. However, it is a good predictor of type 2 diabetes risk and could be used to help monitor people after their risk assessment. It would involve providing simple instructions on how to measure someone's waist correctly. The PDG considered that people over age 74 from all ethnic groups might benefit from type 2 diabetes risk assessment and prevention, as the risk increases with age. However, it recognised that many of the risk-assessment tools are not validated for this age group and that comorbidities may make participation in lifestyle programmes more difficult for some. Nevertheless, there is evidence that older people can benefit from being more physically active and improving their diet. here was little evidence about type 2 diabetes risk assessment for adults aged 18–24 years in any population subgroup. The same was true for people of all ages with severe mental illness or learning disabilities and for those from lower socioeconomic groups. Expert testimony and data suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups are less likely to attend for a risk assessment or a blood test for type 2 diabetes.

Several scenarios involving people aged 40 to 74 years were examined. The NHS Health Check programme was used as a comparator. For people of South Asian descent aged 25–34, usual practice was the comparator. A two-stage risk-assessment process was carried out. People with a high risk score for diabetes, determined by weight-for-height (measured by BMI), anti-hypertensive use, age, sex, family history of diabetes and ethnicity, were given a blood test (either a fasting plasma glucose or an HbA1c test). As a result of the test they were divided into three groups: those diagnosed with diabetes, those at high risk, and those at low or intermediate risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. The high-risk group was offered an intensive lifestyle-change programme. W"
"PH38S4","Risk Identification","Risk identification (stage 2)","Identifying and assessing people at risk of, or with existing (but undiagnosed), diabetes is part of
an integrated approach to preventing vascular diseases through the NHS Health Check
programme.","Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) refers to blood glucose levels that are above normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. (This condition is also known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia or pre-diabetes.) Impaired glucose regulation is used to describe the presence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or both. These are states of abnormal glucose regulation that exist between normal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes. Impaired glucose regulation is characterised by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion which precede the development of type 2 diabetes. However, it has no symptoms and can remain undiagnosed for many years (Diabetes UK 2011). Some prefer the term 'pre-diabetes' because it is a clear way of communicating the presence of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and impaired glucose regulation – and the associated risks of developing type 2 diabetes. However, some health professionals view the term pre-diabetes as potentially misleading, as progression to diabetes is not inevitable. In the absence of any intervention, some people may remain with impaired glucose regulation and some return to normal glucose tolerance (The American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 2008). Pre-diabetes may also be perceived as implying a disease status, without acknowledging the variation in progression rates. In general, the PDG preferred phrases that reflect the spectrum of risk, such as 'lower' or 'increased risk' which convey the idea that everyone could be at risk at some point in their lives. This guidance refers to people at high risk, in keeping with UK and international professional practice and usage. The PDG debated at length whether the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test could be used as an alternative to standard glucose tests to define when someone has impaired glucose regulation. It decided to include people identified by HbA1c, if a venous blood sample was tested in laboratories that meet national quality specifications. The UK expert group on the use of HbA1c testing suggested that a blood glucose measure of 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%) could be used to indicate someone is at high risk of type 2 diabetes (John et al. 2011). Using HbA1c to test for type 2 diabetes has advantages (see Blood tests in the 'Public health need and practice' section). The PDG took into account that the natural progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes (and the risk of cardiovascular disease) is well known and well-reported. Much less is known about the natural progression using HbA1c as the marker. HbA1c is less sensitive to weight change than an oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, it does not adequately reflect glycaemic control over the past 2–3 months for people with certain medical conditions. (This includes haematological disorders, renal failure and long-term excessive alcohol consumption.) Finally, certain drugs (for example, steroids or antipsychotics) may cause rapid rises in blood glucose that is not reflected in HbA1c. A blood glucose test is recommended for people who have recently started steroid or antipsychotic treatment, or have symptoms of diabetes (John et al. 2012). As part of the two-stage approach for identifying people at risk of type 2 diabetes, the PDG has advocated the use of a risk-assessment tool (either self-assessment or practice-based) as a first step. Self-administered questionnaires have the advantage that they can be given out in a range of different places (including shopping centres), or downloaded from the Internet. People identified as being at increased risk can then be offered a blood test or lifestyle advice and support. Practice-based risk-assessment tools, based on routine health service data, have the advantage that all necessary information should already have been collected. The PDG acknowledged that the records would need to be up-to-date and complete to ensure the tools are accurate. The tools allow staff to estimate the percentage of the practice population that is likely to fall into each risk category, and to systematically invite those with a high risk score for further investigation. For example, the top 50% of patients might be designated as high risk and then be invited for a blood test. The remainder can then be divided up accordingly into groups with a low risk score (for example, the lowest quartile who will receive brief advice) and those with an intermediate risk score (who may need more advice about managing their risk). The PDG debated whether certain at-risk groups should be given a blood test without having a risk-assessment score. It thought this approach might be appropriate for young people from high-risk black and minority ethnic groups for whom risk-assessment tools have limited validation. However, it conceded that risk-assessment tools could provide false reassurance to younger age groups. Type 2 diabetes affects people of South Asian, African-Caribbean, Chinese or black African descent up to a decade or more earlier than white Europeans. Bearing this in mind, the PDG considered that there is a case for local areas to consider providing risk assessment and intensive lifestyle-change programmes for people from these groups from the age of 25 onwards. The prevalence of impaired glucose regulation and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes among people aged 25–39 years of black African or African-Caribbean descent in the UK was unclear. So the PDG was unable to estimate cost-effectiveness and make specific recommendations for this population subgroup. However, risk assessments are encouraged and health professionals are advised to provide advice and monitoring according to each person's particular risk profile. There are no 'Read codes' in healthcare computer systems for recording that someone has had a risk assessment, what their level of risk is, and whether or not they have been referred to an intensive lifestyle-change programme. In addition, although there are Read codes for impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance testing, there is not one for an HbA1c test. This may make it difficult for practitioners to communicate with each other about a particular individual's level of risk. The type 2 diabetes prevention trials that provided evidence for this guidance were conducted among adults with impaired glucose tolerance. Measurement of impaired glucose tolerance requires people to fast and to attend 2 hours of tests. Fasting is inconvenient for many people and may not be complied with. Consequently, oral glucose tolerance test results might not always be reliable and the PDG did not consider this test suitable (or practical) for routine clinical practice. Rather, it recommended a two-stage strategy to identify adults at high risk: a risk assessment followed by a blood test (either HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose). The PDG is aware that HbA1c testing does not identify the same at-risk population as that identified by the oral glucose tolerance test. There may be regional variations in the populations identified as high risk using HbA1c, compared to those identified at high risk using the glucose tolerance test. The PDG has made research recommendations accordingly. The mean age of participants in evaluated prevention programmes is between 35 and 55 years. However, evidence from the diabetes prevention study in Finland showed that lifestyle interventions were more effective for older participants. Several scenarios involving people aged 40 to 74 years were examined. The NHS Health Check programme was used as a comparator. For people of South Asian descent aged 25–34, usual practice was the comparator. A two-stage risk-assessment process was carried out. People with a high risk score for diabetes, determined by weight-for-height (measured by BMI), anti-hypertensive use, age, sex, family history of diabetes and ethnicity, were given a blood test (either a fasting plasma glucose or an HbA1c test). As a result of the test they were divided into three groups: those diagnosed with diabetes, those at high risk, and those at low or intermediate risk of progressing to t"
"PH38S5","Matching interventions to risk","Matching interventions to risk","Large-scale trials in Europe, the US and many other countries have consistently shown that the
onset of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed among adults at high risk. A reduction of
over 50% in the risk among this group was demonstrated, following structured lifestyle
interventions during these trials. The lifestyle programmes used behaviour-change strategies to
help people increase their physical activity, eat more healthily and maintain a healthy body
weight. The impact was similar, regardless of ethnicity, or gender.
","The PDG discussed whether it would be effective to intervene with people identified as being at high risk, if they have only been assessed using a risk-assessment tool. Only a small proportion of people identified in this way may have impaired glucose regulation. People at high risk in the prevention programme trials were identified by blood glucose tests not by risk score. More important, while risk scores can identify those at high risk – and those who may have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes – they cannot be used to give a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. However, the PDG recognised that a small proportion of people will refuse a blood test and made a recommendation for them accordingly. The PDG was aware of the importance of ensuring an intensive lifestyle-change programme is available when conveying someone's risk of progression to type 2 diabetes and their potential to modify that risk. As everyone's level of risk differs (and will be a combination of modifiable and non-modifiable factors) the PDG also noted the importance of tailoring prevention activities to meet individual needs. The US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been adapted for use in community settings and includes a different range of people from the original trials. For example, women who have had type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and adults with an HbA1c level between 39 and 47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%). (This is the range recommended by the American Diabetic Association to indicate an increased risk of diabetes.) The UK expert group on HbA1c testing suggested using 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%) to indicate a high risk, despite the fact that someone with lower HbA1c values might also be at risk. The PDG noted that if the HbA1c 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%) range were used as an indicator of high risk in the UK, in some parts of the country 50% of adults aged 40–74 years might qualify (Mostafa et al. 2010).

"PH38S6","Reassessing risk","Reassessing risk","","Evidence shows that informing someone that they are at risk of type 2 diabetes does not harm them – and may have a beneficial effect on their lifestyle. The PDG acknowledged that not everyone identified with impaired glucose regulation will progress to type 2 diabetes. However, it deemed it better if the majority of people at high risk are identified so they can be offered a prevention programme. It also recommended opportunities to be reassessed at least every 5 years, irrespective of someone's level of risk. This means that surveillance is an ongoing process. It also noted that many people with impaired glucose regulation will have modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors that would also benefit from a lifestyle intervention. Frequent monitoring, as carried out in some of the major type 2 diabetes prevention trials, identifies more people as being at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. It can also help motivate people to change their lifestyle."

As a result of the test they were divided into three groups: those diagnosed with diabetes, those at high risk, and those at low or intermediate risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. The high-risk group was offered an intensive lifestyle-change programme. When the risk assessment was followed by an intensive lifestyle-change intervention, this was estimated to be cost effective. The PDG debated whether the cost effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle-change programme might vary between groups with the same risk score but a different HbA1c (specifically an HbA1c of 39 mmol/mol [5.7%] and 42 mmol/mol [6.0%]). It concluded that it was pragmatic to offer programmes to people with an HbA1c of 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%). Recent modelling from the US supports this conclusion (Zhuo et al. 2012b). The PDG recommended an intensive lifestyle-change programme for people with a fasting plasma glucose of 5.5–6.9 mmol/l, after a consideration of the economic modelling. The modelling also showed that more intensive lifestyle-change programmes were estimated to be more cost effective than less intensive programmes. The economic modelling included an analysis of the effect of extending testing to people aged 25–39 years of South Asian descent who were deemed at high risk of diabetes. Provision of risk identification and intensive lifestyle-change programmes was estimated to be cost effective after 20 years and cost saving after 25 years. If a BMI equal to or greater than 23 kg/m2 was used to indicate risk at the first stage of risk assessment (rather than the scoring system used for those aged 40–74), a similar number would identified to be at high risk. For pragmatic reasons, therefore, a BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 was recommended as the indicator of high risk at the first stage of risk assessment for this group. Lack of data meant the analysis could not include people from other ethnic groups aged 25–39 years. However, the findings are likely to apply to other groups where a high proportion of people have a high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes."

Dietary intervention should address the individual’s nutritional needs, taking into account personal choices, cultural preferences and willingness to change, and to ensure that quality of life is optimised. It is usual that a registered dietician plays a key role in providing nutritional care advice within the multidisciplinary diabetes team. It is also recognised that all team members need to be knowledgeable about nutritional therapy, and give emphasis to consistent dietary and lifestyle advice.11","The GDG noted that there was little new evidence to warrant any change to previous views in this field.

psychological ill-health is associated with adverse effects on other aspects of the long-term

Formal assessment of psychological well-being is not a standard part of practice in diabetes care
in the UK. Other guidelines, including the NICE guideline for people with Type 1 diabetes, have

is limited, as the underlying pathogenesis of diabetes worsens with time. As symptoms are not
a reliable guide to blood glucose control in people on therapy, it is important to have an
accurate means of measuring blood glucose control over time, to enable decision-making.

them at risk of hypoglycaemia. More controversial, except for people using insulin, is the use of
self-monitoring to provide feedback on the impact of lifestyle measures on blood glucose
control, and as part of the overall educational package designed to enhance self-care. Indirect
monitoring using urine glucose tests is cheaper, but also delivers less information than plasma
glucose monitoring.
This section addresses the clinical question of the role of self-monitoring of plasma glucose in
people at different stages of the condition and on different therapies, and its integration with
other key processes of care such as patient education.","The newer meta-analyses did not add significantly to the views expressed in the previous Type 2 diabetes guideline. The findings of the ROSSO study44 and the data from the large Kaiser Permanente cohorts 43 added considerable confidence to the view that SMBG was an integral part of effective patient education packages and enabled the effective use of many other therapies and lifestyle interventions. The view in the previous guideline that self-monitoring of plasma glucose is not a stand-alone intervention was endorsed. Concern was expressed over a number of issues surrounding the successful use of selfmonitoring, and recognised that its cost meant that it had to be effectively deployed. It should only be supported in the context of a provision of a package of care, including structured education, from a primary or secondary diabetes care team. The initial education should be provided by a properly trained and skilled professional with understanding of the problems of the technology. Also, the skills of people with diabetes in using the technology should be the subject of regular quality assurance (together with the devices) perhaps as part of the regular annual review process.

However, several models of injector are available, including some designed for those with visual and physical impairments. The clinical question addressed here was whether any particular pen-injector had an evidencebased advantage over any other, including groups of people with difficulty using such devices.","There was no strong published evidence that insulin pen injectors were a preferred option forinsulin injection, but in clinical practice this was not questionable. The studies comparing devices did not compare all devices, were inevitably unblinded, and were manufacturer sponsored in single centres for the most part. The issue of bias was real. It was considered thatsome devices preformed better than others, but also that this was generally known to regular prescribers. Prescribers should be fully familiar with the devices they were recommending; this would be difficult for all the devices available.
One injection device, the InnoLet®, was not a pen injector, but was aimed more at people withphysical disabilities in manipulating injection systems.

"CG66S12","Blood pressure therapy","Blood pressure therapy","People with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, high risk of diabetes eye
damage, and high risk of renal disease. These adverse outcomes are known to be reduced by
improved blood pressure (BP) control, which can be used to lower the risk of stroke, MI,
blindness and renal failure.226 Some other forms of diabetes microvascular damage, including
peripheral nerve damage, are known to be associated with higher BP.227 BP lowering is likely to
be highly cost-effective in people with Type 2 diabetes, more so than in the general population.
A number of clinical questions then face the person with diabetes and their advisors, these include:
  at what levels of BP to initiate therapy whether, and to what extent, those levels should be influenced by particular risk factors(in particular those involved in renal disease)
  what level of BP to aim for, and whether that should be modified by the presence of renal,
eye, or macrovascular damage, what lifestyle measure are effective and cost-effective in lowering BP
 what pharmacological interventions are effective and cost-effective in BP lowering
  how choice of agent might be modified by the presence of end organ damage.
Lifestyle measures (explored elsewhere) and monotherapy medication are known to have
limited efficacy in lowering BP. Additional clinical questions arise over:
  the combinations of medications to be used after first-line therapy
  considerations including synergies of action, side effects of some combinations, and cost.","The GDG noted the problems in assigning BP lowering targets in this area, and in particular the  problem setting a cut-off where the evidence suggests ‘the lower the blood pressure the better (without adverse effects)’ difficulties of achieving any reasonable target in some people individual targets that should logically vary with individual risk arbitrary dichotomy that arises immediately above and below any target level. The results of some RCTs suggested that SBP well into the normal range (below usual target values) was both achievable and associated with benefit in people with Type 2 diabetes, consistent with epidemiological evidence from other studies. In some other studies tight BP control seemed difficult to achieve, consistent with the group’s clinical experience. This led the group to take a simple risk approach centered on a target level of <140/80 mmHg for most people with Type 2 diabetes, and <130/80 mmHg for those at more particular risk. The latter group included people with raised albumin excretion rate (AER) (microalbuminuria or worse), eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, those with retinopathy, and those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The concern that more active prevention was being targeted at those who had already developed end-organ damage was recognised, but it was noted that for both microalbuminuria (chapter 16) and early retinopathy (chapter 17) the recommendations on annual surveillance meant that markers of damage would be detected many years before ill health ensued.

"CG66S13","Cardiovascular Risk Estimation","Cardiovascular Risk Estimation","Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk – high enough to justify
statin therapy without further assessment.273 Others are at more extreme risk.273 Other therapies
in addition to cholesterol-modifying drugs used to ameliorate CV risk include blood glucose
lowering, blood pressure (BP) lowering, and anti-platelet therapies (see recommendations in these
areas), together with lifestyle measures. Logically the intensity with which these therapies are used
should be determined in part by the level of risk. To a limited extent this can be assessed clinically
by summation of presence of risk factors (high waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) level, HbA1c, BP, smoking, family history of premature vascular disease,
ethnic group, abnormal serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride
(TG)) or the presence of particular risk factors (microalbuminuria, previous CV event). However,
many of these variables are continuous distributions so it makes sense to ask whether tools are
available that make full use of the data which could be made available from their measurement. As
diabetes itself is a risk factor, any such approach would have to be diabetes specific. 
The clinical questions addressed were whether any risk calculator (risk engine) or risk chart,
specifically designed for people with diabetes, gave valid and useful assessments of CV risk in
people with diabetes, and in what circumstances they might be used.","The UKPDS risk engine and to a lesser extent the older JBS-2 charts had some evidence of validity in people with Type 2 diabetes, at least once over the age of 40 years. However, in their latest revision JBS-2 charts for people with Type 2 diabetes are not available. Other estimations based on the Framingham population were not reliable, and the reasons for this were understood. No system included all the desirable variables, with the exception of Archimedes, but this was not intended as a clinical tool.  It was noted that a wide range of epidemiological studies suggested that people with diabeteswere over twice as likely as the background population (age and sex matched) to develop CVD, and that many had confounding factors (such as use of antihypertensive or glucose-lowering medications) which prevented use of calculators. Studies such as the UK validation analysis reported above were clearly not consistent epidemiologically with UK populations at diagnosis, and furthermore excluded people already on therapy, and are therefore not reliable as a means of estimating the size of the population justifying therapy except for comparing tools. The group concluded that the normal approach, once age was considered, of managing nearly all
people with Type 2 diabetes as having risk >20%/10-years was appropriate, particularly as outcome from MI is known to be worse for those with diabetes, and preventative therapy therefore more cost effective. 
Particular concerns were also expressed by the GDG over people with microalbuminuria, those with more extreme family histories of CVD, and those with previous and recurrent CV events. This and the age problem meant that it was recognised that any risk estimation had a limited role. However, the GDG were also concerned that some people with Type 2 diabetes do not have the classical phenotype of the disease with abdominal adiposity (or obesity) and low HDL-C. It was concerned that such people should be recognised at diagnosis and managed more conservatively.

"CG66S14","Management of blood lipid levels","Management of blood lipid levels","Nearly all people with Type 2 diabetes are at high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Epidemiologicallythat excess risk is independently associated with their hyperglycaemia together with high blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidaemia, the last typically the low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and raised triglyceride (TG) levels found as components of the metabolic syndrome.280 Studies have suggested that people with Type 2 diabetes without declared cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at as high a risk of a CVD event as someone without diabetes with declared CVD.273 While this is disputed by other studies, it still leaves individuals with Type 2 diabetes as nearly always in the high CVD risk category, and accordingly it has been usual to manage them actively as if for secondary rather than primary prevention of CVD. Nevertheless, in a few people with Type 2 diabetes the clinical phenotype is not that associated with high CV risk, albeit these people being generally remarkable for not being overweight nor having features of the metabolic syndrome, and being insulin sensitive. More importantly people with Type 2 diabetes who have declared CVD are at much higher risk (>1.5–2.6) of further events or CV death as people with CVD without diabetes.273 Such extreme risk would appear to justify more intensive management than usually offered to someone who has, for example, had a heart attack.  The management of CV risk through glucose lowering, BP lowering, and anti-platelet therapy is dealt with elsewhere in this guideline. This chapter deals with lipid-lowering therapy; dietary modification also being dealt with in a separate chapter. Paradoxically, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not particularly raised in people with Type 2 diabetes compared to the background population, the opportunity to lower risk through lipid management is currently greatest through drugs which lower LDL-C, principally the statins.Nevertheless, a variety of other lipid modifying drugs are available and will be considered in turn. 
","The GDG reviewed the evidence, and their clinical experience of trying to manage the complexities of CV risk in clinical practice. They recognised the primacy of trying to control risk cost effectively against treating-to-target, but also noted the practical utility of measurements in assessing response to therapies and providing motivation to people with diabetes. Ultimately theissue of cost effectiveness could only be resolved in the context of the interventions being used to modify the lipid profile, and the evidence in this area was therefore subsumed into the recommendations on the use of CV risk estimation, statins and fibrates. 
"
"CG66S15","Statins and ezetimibe","Statins and ezetimibe","Cholesterol lowering remained difficult, and indeed controversial, until the late 1980s when statins became available. Subsequently these drugs became the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy, supported eventually by CV outcome studies. As discussed above, people with Type 2 diabetes are at high CV risk, and most of their morbidity and increased mortality comes from coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial disease. In earlier NICE technology appraisals (TAs) and the prior Type 2 diabetes guideline, statins were recommended for all people with extant CVD or at high risk thereof, states which include most people with Type 2 diabetes.283 Clinical questions which arise include whether more potent and more expensive statins should ever be used (and if so when), the use of statins in younger people with Type 2 diabetes, whether any people should not be routinely given statins, and the use of alternatives such as fibrates (addressed in the following fibrate section) and ezetimibe addressed by a 2007 NICE TA.2","The GDG were cognisant of the previous NICE statin appraisal, the prior Type 2 diabetes guidelines, the ezetimibe appraisal, the deliberations of the NICE guidelines group on management of CVD, and the health economic analysis. The evidence of effectiveness and safety of generic statins, and in particular simvastatin seemed clear, and at current prices probably cost saving in the population with Type 2 diabetes over the age of 40 years (irrespective of experienceof CVD). There may be individuals in this group at lower CV risk (discussed in section 13), butthese people would be uncommon and easily identified by the absence of CV risk factors (see13.1.6). In others statin therapy should usually be with generic simvastatin at standard dosage(40 mg) in line with the prior TA283 and the Heart Protection Study. The group recognised that some people below the age of 40 years were also at high risk (10 year risk >20%, or 20 year risk >40%). It was considered that they would have to be identified by conventional risk factors; presence of features of the metabolic syndrome, strong family history, ethnic group, and evidence of microvascular damage such as nephropathy. Such people would then be treated with a statin, particularly as their 10-year risk horizon came to include 40 yearsof age or greater. However, the contraindication of the use of statins in pregnancy was felt to begreat enough to deserve special mention, for any woman of childbearing potential. The health economic analysis suggested titration to simvastatin 80 mg was highly cost-effective in those whose lipid levels were not controlled to target levels of 4.0/2.0 mmol/l (T-/LDL-C) irrespective of presence or absence of diagnosed CVD.  In those with CVD the health economic analysis suggested that uptitration from simvastatin 80 mg to a more efficacious statin (modelled as atorvastatin 80 mg daily) was cost-effective if the titration targets were not met on the simvastatin. 

"
"CG66S16","Fibrates","Fibrates","Fibrates have a long and controversial history as lipid-lowering agents, beginning with clofibrate
over 30 years ago and being implicated in the problems which led to withdrawal of cerivastatin
in the 1990s. However, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and ciprofibrate have shown considerable staying
power in the market. Statins have, however, eclipsed fibrates as primary cholesterol-lowering
agents, so the issues surrounding fibrates relate to specific lipid abnormalities. In clinical practice
these mostly concern hypertriglyceridaemia, itself strongly associated with low HDL-C levels,
this problem being particularly common in people with Type 2 diabetes (more so than raised
LDL-C levels).
The clinical question then relates to whether and when a fibrate should be initiated before statin
therapy, and the circumstances under which a fibrate should be added to, or substituted for,
statin therapy","While the evidence was not as strong as for the statins, there was convincing evidence of the effectiveness of fibrates in CV protection in people with Type 2 diabetes. Some of the trials (e.g. FIELD) in which this evidence was found included people with TG levels down to the upper end of the normal range (~1.8 mmol/l). However, while the price of fibrates was considerably above that of generic statins, the more effective fibrates as judged by TG lowering were about half the price of proprietary statins when both are used at standard doses.  Hypertriglyceridaemia is a complex condition with both a genetic basis and often being secondary to other medical conditions, including poor blood glucose control. The GDG recognised it was not writing a guideline on management of hypertriglyceridaemia in people with Type 2 diabetes, but because of the interaction with blood glucose control and other medical conditions often associated with Type 2 diabetes (including renal impairment and liver disease), it could not avoid some general guidance in the area. 
In drawing up the recommendations the GDG was also cognisant of the need to be aware of: 
? the likely combination with statin therapy (given its recommendations on statins) and the
higher rate of side effects of combined usage 
? the more immediate risks of pancreatitis with higher levels of TGs
? the difficulty of assessing LDL-C levels when TG levels were above 4.5 mmol/l. A useful
pragmatic compromise was felt to be to base recommendations around cut-off levels of
2.3 and 4.5 mmol/l. There is evidence of differences between fibrates: gemfibrozil had greater interactions with
other drugs commonly used in diabetes care; bezafibrate was cheaper and less effective in TG
lowering and with a poorer CV evidence base than fenofibrate; and ciprofibrate was more poorly investigated. Therefore recommendations were based around fenofibrate, though with a role for bezafibrate where CV risk was less pronounced, and ciprofibrate as an alternative. Further information on fibrate statin combinations might become available when the ACCORD trial reports.35"
"CG66S17","Nicotinic acid and derivatives","Nicotinic acid and derivatives","Abnormalities of blood lipid profiles, including serum HDL-C and TGs, are recognised CV riskfactors, and are particularly likely to be abnormal in people with Type 2 diabetes. Nicotinic acid preparations are one approach to improving lipid profiles. Nicotinic acid administration isassociated with side effects due to vasodilatation, and derivatives (acipimox) and modified-release preparations have been made available to try and reduce the problem. The clinical question is then what role nicotinic acid derivatives might have in the management of Type 2 diabetes.","This group of drugs was not considered in the previous guideline (2002).414 The limitednumber of studies presented suggested that nicotinic acid can have some advantageous effect on serum HDL-C and lipids, but also that it has some negative effects on blood glucose control. In the absence of outcome trials in people with Type 2 diabetes, and given also the problems of using the current preparations (notably flushing despite prophylactic aspirin, dose titration and use of modified-release preparations), no general recommendation could be given for use of nicotinic acid. The group were aware of some possible special indications in people with extreme hypertriglyceridaemia, but felt this to be outside the remit of the current guideline."
"CG66S18","Omega 3 fish oils","Omega 3 fish oils","The concept of beneficial and harmful dietary fats has come to the fore in recent years. Some
evidence does exist for the use of omega 3 fish oils in certain circumstances such as post-MI.
The clinical question then was what role these oils might have in the management of people
with Type 2 diabetes.","From the evidence available fish oils as a homogeneous therapeutic concept is problematic, as the evidence included showed a variation in the fish oil dosage used. Clinical experience confirmed that large total doses of oils used to get an adequate dose of omega 3 fish oils in some preparations can cause adverse effects. From the evidence available omega 3 fish oil preparations could help lower TG levels, but overall showed minimal improvement in lipid profiles in people who had not had a MI. The GDG agreed there were financial consequences in prescribing omega 3 supplements when the evidence showed no clear benefit.
It was recognised that the recommendations made must be understood as only applying for omega 3 fish oil supplementation, and not to recommendations on sources of dietary fats."
"CG66S19","Antithrombotic therapy","Antithrombotic therapy","Antiplatelet therapy now has an established role in the management of people at high risk of
cardiovascular (CV) events. People with Type 2 diabetes are known to have CV risk higher than
matched populations after allowance for other CV risk factors, and in some studies as high as
those without diabetes who have declared cardiovascular disease (CVD).273 National guidelines
and the previous NICE (inherited) Type 2 diabetes guideline recommend use of aspirin in people
at high CV risk.319,320 Other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel and dipyridamole modified release
(MR)) have been the subject of a NICE technology appraisal (TA) but without specific calculation
for the higher CV event rate or the specific risk reduction in people with Type 2 diabetes.321 The
increasing occurrence of Type 2 diabetes in younger people raises the additional question of the
use of antiplatelet therapy in those who CV risk may be not be very high.
The guidelines are not concerned with the use of antiplatelet therapy after acute cardiological
events or cardiac interventions, or after acute cerebrovascular events. 
The clinical question then is whether antiplatelet medications should be used in people with
Type 2 diabetes, or in which subgroups of such people, and if so which agents and in what doses.","Little extra evidence of note on use of aspirin was available since the last review. However, there is now better understanding of the extent of the CV risk faced by people with Type 2 diabetes. The rather poor direct evidence for people with Type 2 diabetes led to difficulties in assessing the level of risk above which aspirin therapy should be advised. The GDG accepts that its view that all people at, or over, the age of 50 years should treated is somewhat arbitrary. Primary prevention below that age would be by assessment of higher CV risk (family history of premature vascular disease, abnormal lipid profile, marked abdominal adiposity). While thegroup were aware of some discussions over the dose of aspirin to be used in people withdiabetes, they were not presented with any evidence that could lead to a variation from the usual national recommendations of 75 mg.NICE guidance for dipyridamole MR related only to people with cerebrovascular events. The evidence for the use of clopidogrel was noted to relate to acute and non-acute situations. The current guideline review was not concerned with acute vascular events or interventions. The CHARISMA and MATCH trials suggested that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel
carried a significant side-effect risk of a serious nature not balanced by secure health gain, and therefore could not be generally recommended. NICE guidance for secondary prevention of vascular events in people without diabetes was that clopidogrel should not be used instead of aspirin except where intolerance or hypersensitivity to the latter was present. The specific evidence for people with diabetes, mostly sub-analyses, did not suggest that advice should be varied for people with Type 2 diabetes."
"CG66S20","Kidney damage","Diabetes kidney disease management","Kidney disease in people with Type 2 diabetes is becoming an ever larger health burden.336 This reflects a number of trends including the increasing prevalence of people with diabetes, the better cardiovascular (CV) survival with modern management, and the better management of progression of kidney damage itself.

"CG66S21","Eye damage","Eye damage","Diabetes eye damage is the single largest cause of blindness before old age with a progressive
incidence in people with Type 2 diabetes.346 The success of laser therapy in the treatment of
sight-threatening retinopathy is an accepted part of ophthalmological care and has not been
assessed for this guideline. 
Appropriate clinical questions to be addressed are, however, how people with developing
retinopathy can be selected for ophthalmological referral in time for optimal treatment, and
whether preventative therapy other than good blood glucose, good blood pressure, and good
blood lipid control can be useful in people with Type 2 diabetes.","It was noted that management in this area was largely determined by practice for all people with diabetes and not just those with Type 2 diabetes. Indeed retinopathy screening programmes to
be provided on a local community basis were a key early target of the National Service Framework (NSF) for diabetes, and since that time the UK National Screening Programme has published and updated a workbook on ‘Essential elements in developing a diabetic retinopathy screening programme’ for the guidance of health authorities and primary care trusts in England (fourth edition, January 2007).347 These observations, and a lack of awareness amongst experts of new publications that might affect recommendations on retinopathy screening, led to the conclusion that recommendations
for people with Type 2 diabetes should closely follow those for Type 1 diabetes (NICE guideline 2004),26 which themselves were largely based on generic evidence independent of type of diabetes. 
Accordingly the recommendations of the Type 1 diabetes guidelines, and the evidence
statements underlying them were reviewed, together with the national screening document.
There are no significant changes from the Type 1 diabetes recommendations.

It can take many forms, and is often distressing and sometimes depressing, particularly if symptoms are predominantly nocturnal and disturb sleep. People with diabetes may be reluctant to report the symptoms to those with expertise in diabetes care, because of lack of awareness that the problem is diabetes related. A number of drug and non-drug approaches to management are available, this diversity reflecting that none of them are fully effective.
Clinically the issues are when to start specific drug therapy for neuropathic pain, which medications to use, and in what order to try them.","A more holistic approach was often needed at discovery of the problem in helping people tounderstand it, where secondary psychological problems occurred, and when onward referral was needed to specialist pain teams for lack of response to conventional measures."
"CG66S23","Gastroparesis","Gastroparesis","Gastroparesis can be one of the more devastating complications of autonomic neuropathy.
While it can present as bloating, nausea and fullness on eating, severe intermittent hypoglycaemia can be a major problem for people on glucose-lowering therapy, while vomiting may be intermittent and sudden or occasionally severe and protracted. The clinical questions addressed include in whom to suspect gastroparesis might be present, what medications might help, and what other measures might be taken.","The evidence reported had methodological limitations, notably studies of small sample sizes.The GDG agreed that there is a poor evidence base for the treatment of gastroparesis. Nevertheless they noted that the evidence reported suggested that the prokinetic drugs, metoclopramide, domperidone, along with erythromycin, were all effective in at least some people with gastroparesis resulting from autonomic neuropathy. On consideration of the evidence it was not possible to distinguish usefully between the prokinetic drugs. The group agreed that choice of initial therapy should be based on tolerability issues, including drug interactions. It was noted that differential diagnosis can be difficult, and the diagnostic tests not secure, while serious prolonged vomiting could become a medical emergency. Accordingly referral beyond diabetes services is sometimes indicated.
While the group gave priority to medication for the management of this condition, clinical experience suggested that non-pharmacological approaches including postural advice and timing of ingestion of fluids and solids could prove useful to some people."

","Measuring kidney function 
","The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all of thefunctioning nephrons and is the best index of overall kidney function. Knowledge of GFR isessential for the diagnosis and management of CKD and is a translatable concept. Because a normal GFR is roughly 100 ml/min/1.73 m2, we can explain kidney function to patients and carers in terms of a percentage of normal – a more easily understandable concept than GFR.  The gold standard methods of estimating GFR require measurement of an ideal filtration marker. These markers should be freely filtered by the glomerulus, should not be bound to plasma proteins, must be excreted unchanged and not be subject to either tubular secretion or absorption. Commonly used markers include inulin, 51Cr-EDTA, 125I-iothalamate and iohexol. Gold standard methods of assessing GFR are technically demanding, expensive, time consuming and unsuitable for widespread identification of CKD in the ‘at risk’ population. 
At the other end of the accuracy scale lies measurement of serum creatinine, which is a universally available endogenous test of kidney function. Although easy and cheap to measure, creatinine is subject to non-renal and analytical influences which make it insufficiently sensitive to detect moderate CKD on its own. Measurement of 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance improves the accuracy but is also subject to the same non-renal and analytical influences compounded by inaccuracies in urine collection, to say nothing of the inconvenience associated with 24-hour urine collections. An alternative and more accurate endogenous marker is cystatin C, a 13 kDa cationic protein produced by all nucleated cells. Serum cystatin C levels are chiefly determined by GFR. Potential limitations of cystatin C as a marker of GFR include lack of assay standardisation, the requirement for a dedicated analytical system, and increased costs relative to serum creatinine (approximately £3/assay compared to <£0.10/assay).
A further alternative is to measure serum creatinine and estimate GFR using an equation which corrects for some of the more significant non-renal influences. This approach is known to be more sensitive for the detection of CKD than serum creatinine and more accurate than creatinine clearance.
So what have previous guideline groups recommended? The SIGN guidelines 32 recommended use of prediction equations in place of 24-hour creatinine clearance or serum creatinine alone and preferred prediction equations to cystatin C on the grounds of practical and resource considerations. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was preferred to the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The UK CKD guidelines and the UK consensus conference recommended use of the 4-variable MDRD equation using zero biased creatinine methods.33,34Others (KDOQI, CARI and KDIGO)14,35–37 have recommended that serum creatinine should not be used alone to assess kidney function, that creatinine assays should be traceable to a = reference creatinine method, and that an estimated GFR should be reported by laboratories
alongside the serum creatinine measurement using the 4-variable MDRD equation. 
","The evidence suggests that in general the 4-variable MDRD performs better than the Cockcroft- Gault equation. However, in older people and in people with GFR greater than 60ml/min/1.73 m2 the MDRD is subject to bias and can underestimate GFR. The GDG noted that serum creatinine is correlated with muscle mass and therefore estimation of GFR using prediction equations in people with extremes of muscle mass is subject to inaccuracy. In those with increased muscle mass GFR will be under estimated and in those withreduced muscle mass GFR will be over estimated. 
Gold standard measures of GFR are time consuming and expensive to perform but where a highly accurate measurement of GFR is required, for example in assessment of kidney donors or for accurate calculation of dosing of potentially toxic chemotherapy, the evidence suggests that GFR estimated from prediction equations is insufficiently accurate. The GDG agreed that significant changes in GFR are equally important in those individuals with GFR greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Where laboratories do not report levels of GFR greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 the GDG considered that a rise in serum creatinine of greater than 20% should be considered significant.
Although the original MDRD equation included a correction factor for the American black population, there are no correction factors for other populations and in routine use the derived GFR is not corrected for any ethnicity other than African-Caribbean.  Although most laboratories would be capable of measuring cystatin C concentrations there isno evidence to suggest that it was more useful than using the MDRD, with the caveat thatexisting evidence comparing cystatin C and the MDRD failed to appropriately calibrate serumcreatinine measurements to the method of the MDRD laboratory. Cystatin C measurement is also currently more expensive"
"CG73S2"," Investigating chronic kidney disease 
","Factors affecting the biological and analytical variability of  GFR estimated from measurement of serum creatinine 
","The measurement of serum creatinine to estimate GFR with predictive equations is subject to biological and analytical variation.  Biological variation includes random variation and predictable cyclical variation (daily, monthly, seasonal). Within-subject biological variation is the average random fluctuation around a homeostatic set point, expressed mathematically as a coefficient of variation (CV).55 Large variations in serum creatinine measurements could result in misclassification of people to a particular CKD stage. Factors affecting measured serum creatinine concentration and estimated GFR from prediction equations include ingestion of cooked meat (where the cooking process converts meat creatine to creatinine, which is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream after ingestion), individual patient fluid status, diurnal variation, and centrifugation of blood samples. 
Plasma creatinine measurements also vary depending on the method/analyser used and there is inter-laboratory variation which changes with creatinine concentration. There is no (single) standard method used across England. Method precision at higher levels of creatinine has less variability and thus has marginal impact on the interpretation of eGFR from prediction equations. However, in the critical diagnostic range there is concern that inter-method/laboratory variation may impact on the diagnostic utility of eGFR. This is probably at creatinine concentrations of less than 180 µmol/l. If creatinine levels are overestimated because of method bias/variability this will result in a reduced eGFR (false positives) and misclassification of CKD. This will lead to increased referral rates and inappropriate labelling of patients as having CKD. If
creatinine levels are underestimated, the reverse will happen (false negatives). 
Since April 2006, creatinine assays in chemistry laboratories in England have been calibrated to the gold standard reference method of isotope dilution mass spectrophotometry (IDMS) through the National External Quality Assurance Scheme. This has enabled reporting of an IDMS-related MDRD derived eGFR to minimise interlaboratory variation in GFR results. This section addresses other sources of bias and variation in creatinine measurement.","The GDG noted that although the biochemical assay for creatinine is precise, a number of factors affect serum creatinine levels, particularly the person’s state of hydration and whether they had recently eaten meat. Serum creatinine concentrations also show diurnal variation. This means that
the eGFR derived using the 4-variable MDRD equation will also be affected by these factors.
When making a diagnosis of CKD, assessing the stage of CKD, or monitoring patients for evidence of declining kidney function, it is important that clinicians are aware of the factors that can influence creatinine concentrations. It was recommended that whenever possible they take steps to minimise the biases that these factors introduce and that they are aware that changes of less than 5% may simply be due to biological and analytical variability. Whilst a simple solution to the variability introduced by eating meat would be to recommend an overnight fast before having a blood sample taken, it was agreed that this was unnecessarily restrictive."
"CG73S3"," Investigating chronic kidney disease 
","Detection of blood and protein in the urine","The persistent presence of protein (proteinuria), albumin (albuminuria), or red blood cells (haematuria) in urine is evidence of kidney damage. Diagnostic tests that can rapidly detect the presence of protein or red blood cells in urine with high specificity and sensitivity are integral to the early detection and management of CKD.  Haematuria is defined as the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine, either visible
(macroscopic haematuria) or invisible and detected by direct microscopy (microscopic haematuria). A reagent strip test to detect blood in urine provides an instant result and is often the method of detection of invisible haematuria in the primary care setting.67 The reagent strip or ‘dipstick’ test is commonly considered to be sensitive for the detection of RBCs below the defined (microscopic) 3 RBCs per high power field threshold for invisible haematuria. Dipstick testing of spot urine samples is also used for rapid detection of protein and albumin. However, reagent strips are subject to false positives because of patient dehydration, exercise, infection, and extremely alkaline urine. False negative results occur as a result of excessive hydration and urine proteins other than albumin. 
Haematuria can be broadly classified as nephrological or urological in origin. Most forms of intrinsic kidney disease may result in invisible haematuria. Urological causes include tumours, urinary tract infection, stone disease and bleeding from benign conditions of the urinary tract. Invisible haematuria may also be detected in the absence of any underlying pathology, such as after vigorous exercise.68 The prevalence of asymptomatic invisible haematuria varies between 0.19% and 21%, depending on age and gender. Screening studies have suggested that the prevalence of asymptomatic invisible haematuria in the UK adult male population is around 2.5%, increasing to 22% in men over the age of 60 years.69,70","It was noted that reagent strips have been used to identify and quantify the presence of albumin, total protein and red blood cells in a urine sample. Some reagent strips identify the presence of
both haematuria and proteinuria. There was no evidence to suggest one type of reagent strip performed better than the others. It was noted that the reagent strips used to detect proteinuria in routine clinical practice are predominantly sensitive to albumin not to total protein. When considering the evidence concerning haematuria the GDG were aware that in many circumstances haematuria is a feature of urological disease rather than CKD.
Unless performed using phase contrast microscopy on a sample that has been received promptly, laboratory assessment of haematuria is less accurate than reagent strip testing because of cell lysis during transport to the laboratory and inaccuracies in quantifying the red blood cells present. There is no consensus about whether a ‘trace’ or one ‘+’ should be considered positive when testing for haematuria using reagent strips. The GDG recommended that the presence of one ‘+’ should be considered positive.
When considering nephrological causes of haematuria it was noted that most clinicians would need evidence of concurrent proteinuria (ACR >30 mg/mmol) and/or evidence of deterioration in GFR before recommending renal biopsy. 
When considering the use of reagent strips to identify or quantify proteinuria it was again noted that although 24-hour urine collections for urinary protein estimation have been considered to
be the ‘gold standard’ they are subject to inaccuracies due to incomplete collection of all urine voided or inaccurate timing, and the biochemical methods used to quantify the amount of
protein present give different results. There is no evidence about the frequency with which testing for proteinuria should subsequently
be repeated. 
It was noted that the timing of the urine sample was important to get a meaningful result. A morning sample is best as the urine is most concentrated and thus the concentration of protein will be highest and more likely to be detected. It was recognised, however, that stipulating that testing should only be undertaken on morning samples would cause practical difficulties for service organisation and might inhibit opportunistic testing.
The GDG noted that use of reagent strip tests for identification of significant proteinuria was dependent on urine concentration, rendering them unreliable for both detection of small
amounts of proteinuria and for accurately quantifying the degree of proteinuria.  ACR is the test of choice to identify proteinuria in people with diabetes and is already widely used in practice. Albumin is the predominant component of proteinuria in glomerular disease, however the non-diabetic CKD literature reviewed in this guideline is based on 24-hour urinary protein excretion. 
It is this guideline’s purpose to improve early identification and help prevent progression of CKD. Epidemiological study increasingly underlines the importance of even a low level of
proteinuria as a strong predictor of adverse outcome. Reagent strips in current clinical practice predominantly detect albumin, not total protein, but are not reliably quantitative. Studies to inform intervention levels of ACR in non-diabetic CKD are not yet available and it is not possible to derive a simple correction factor that allows the precise conversion of ACR values to PCR. However, ACR has far greater sensitivity than PCR for the detection of low levels of proteinuria and thus lends itself to detection and identification of CKD.
When the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence is all taken into account, considerable uncertainty remains about the choice of ACR or PCR. Clinical opinion was divided among stakeholder organisations and within the GDG, but given the considerations above, the GDG made a consensus recommendation that ACR should be the test of choice to identify proteinuria and possible chronic kidney disease. The GDG however also noted that there will often be good clinical reasons for subsequently using PCR to quantify and monitor significant levels of proteinuria.
The GDG noted that an ACR of =30 mg/mmol, or PCR =50 mg/mmol in association with haematuria or an ACR =70 mg/mmol, or PCR =100 mg/mmol in the absence of haematuria were considered indications for referral to nephrology (see section 6.1.4). It was agreed that the finding of levels of ACR <70 mg/mmol, or PCR <100 mg/mmol should be confirmed using an early morning urine sample.

"CG73S4"," Investigating chronic kidney disease 
","Urinary albumin:creatinine and protein:creatinine ratios,  and their relationship to 24-hour urinary protein","Proteinuria is a cardinal sign of kidney disease. Measurement of total protein in urine is a traditional, inexpensive and well established test for kidney injury. A vast body of nephrological literature is predicated on 24-hour urinary total protein. Significant proteinuria is an independent risk factor for both progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Monitoring of urinary proteinuria is both part of the routine evaluation of those at risk of CKD and is an important method of assessing progression and response to therapy.  Proteins normally excreted in the urine include albumin, low molecular weight immunoglobulin (filtered plasma proteins), and secreted tubular proteins. There is no consistent definition of proteinuria. The upper limit of normal is approximately 150 mg/24 h, equivalent to a protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) of 15 mg/mmol (given an average daily urine creatinine excretion of 10 mmol), but the cut off for abnormal varies from laboratory to laboratory. By contrast, urinary albumin measurement provides a quantitative, relatively standardised measurement of excretion of the single most important protein in most nephropathies. The normal mean value for urine albumin is 10 mg/day, microalbuminuria is defined as 30–300 mg/day or an albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) of >2.5 mg/mmol in men and >3.5 mg/mmol in women. Macroalbuminuria is a urinary albumin greater than 300 mg/day (ACR >30 mg/mmol).","Although 24-hour urine collections for protein and albumin are often used in diagnostic
studies as the ‘gold standard’, 24-hour collections are subject to inaccuracies due to incomplete
collection of all urine voided or inaccurate timing and the biochemical methods used to
quantify the amount of protein present will give different results. Further, the objective of these
tests in clinical practice is to detect people with CKD at increased risk of progression, and it is
not yet established whether either one of proteinuria or albuminuria is superior to the other in
this regard.
The evidence reviewed for the measurement of protein, albumin, PCR and ACR came from
different disease groups, and in some cases different ethnic groups. The GDG noted that the
influence of either disease or ethnicity on actual measurement was questionable.
ACR and PCR overcome inaccuracies related to timing of collection and incomplete urine
collection but measure different proteins.
For the identification of proteinuria in routine clinical practise a single test has been
recommended.
The amount of albuminuria was considered the most relevant measurement and has the
advantage that the amount of albumin can be accurately measured if an immunologic assay is
used.
The cost-effectiveness analysis (Appendix C) showed that ACR (performed in a hospital laboratory) was more cost-effective than the use of protein or albumin reagent strips. In a sensitivity analysis, we found that ACR has to be only very slightly more accurate than PCR for ACR to be cost-effective across a range of plausible cost differentials. It is not possible to derive a simple correction factor that allows the conversion of ACR values to PCR or 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates because the relative amounts of albumin and other proteins will vary depending on the clinical circumstances; however, the GDG produced a table of approximate equivalents that will allow clinicians unfamiliar with ACR values to see the approximate equivalent PCR and 24-hour urinary protein excretion rates (Table 4.5)."
"CG73S6","Classification and early identification","The influence of GFR, age, gender, ethnicity and  proteinuria on patient outcomes","If we cannot prevent CKD then we want to minimise the associated adverse outcomes. To do this we need to know:
? what the adverse outcomes are
? at what level of GFR we should be alert to adverse outcomes and
? the impact of associated factors such as age, gender and presence or absence of
proteinuria at any given level of GFR. 
Large population studies have clearly suggested that the risk of death, hospitalisation and cardiovascular events rises exponentially at levels of GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.13 Other complications associated with reduced GFR, such as the increased potential for dose-relateddrug toxicity, are less obvious but equally important. 
The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) stratified chronic kidney disease into five stages according to glomerular filtration rate and the
presence of kidney damage:
? Stage 1: GFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2with other evidence of kidney damage (persistent microalbuminuria, persistent proteinuria, persistent haematuria, structural abnormalities of the kidneys demonstrated on ultrasound scanning or other radiological tests, or biopsy-proven chronic glomerulonephritis)
? Stage 2: GFR 60–89 ml/min/1.73 m2 with other evidence of kidney damage
? Stage 3: GFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m2
? Stage 4: GFR 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m2
? Stage 5: GFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2","There has been debate about the implications of having a reduced GFR and, in particular, whether a stable GFR that does not change over time is associated with adverse health outcomes. Not all studies stratified patients according to whether or not they had diabetes and this may affect estimates of the risk of death. The evidence suggested that if the GFR is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, then there is an
increased risk of mortality which is seen in all age groups.  There was limited evidence about outcomes in older people. However, given that they are at increased absolute risk of mortality and cardiovascular events it was agreed that even small increases in relative risk in older people are of significance. The GDG considered that the evidence suggested that the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events increased considerably when the GFR was less than 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. This led to the proposal to adopt the sub-division of stage 3 CKD into stages 3A and 3B, defined by an eGFR 45–59 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 30–44 ml/min/1.73m2 respectively.

"CG73S7","Classification and early identification","Who should be tested for CKD?","The early identification and treatment of CKD is essential to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, progression to ESRD, and mortality. Identification of high-risk groups can help clinicians
monitor renal function and identify people with CKD at an earlier disease stage. Although general population screening may not be cost-effective, targeted screening directed at subgroups of the population who might derive the most benefit from CKD detection was shown to be an effective strategy.138 A national programme to identify vulnerability to vascular diseases was announced by the Health Secretary in April 2008, following initial results from modelling work carried out by the Department of Health. This work suggested that a vascular check programme would prevent 4000 people a year from developing diabetes and could also detect at least 25,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier. In those conditions where the prevalence of CKD is high and the risks of preventable complications are increased, testing for CKD is clearly warranted. The KEEP programme identified people with diabetes and hypertension, or people with a first-line relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) with diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney
disease as being at high risk of CKD. Are there additional high-risk people who should be tested for CKD? The UK CKD guidelines also included those with a high risk of obstructive uropathy,
all forms of CVD, multisystem diseases with the potential to involve the kidney such as SLE, and conditions requiring long-term treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs.33 In addressing this question all of these factors were considered, together with other lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity and alcohol intake.The 2014 GDG voted that recommendation 31 shoud be a key priority for implementation as the 
recommendation was likely to have a high impact on outcomes that are important to patients and include actions that are measurable. They felt that this recommendation could be a key target for  primary care and could be collected within CKD National Audit.","When considering this evidence the GDG was particularly concerned with facilitating the early identification of people with CKD so that they may benefit from treatment to prevent worsening kidney function.
The GDG considered that multisystem diseases with the potential to involve the kidney, such as SLE, were clearly risk factors for CKD. The evidence principally assessed demographic and behavioural risk factors for CKD but in addition it was recognised that diabetes and cardiovascular disease, particularly ischaemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease are all risk
factors for CKD. The GDG noted that the increased prevalence of CKD seen in the NHANES studies (1988–1994 compared with 1999–2004) was associated with an increased prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and hypertension. There was uncertainly regarding the significance of a family history of CKD but the GDG recommended that people with a family history of stage 5 CKD or hereditary kidney disease
should be considered at risk of having CKD. GDG consensus was that those with structural renal tract disease, multiple and recurrent renal calculi and urinary outflow tract obstruction should be considered at risk of having CKD. The GDG also recommended that people found incidentally to have haematuria or proteinuria on opportunistic medical testing should be considered at risk of having CKD.
The cost-effectiveness evidence suggests that testing for CKD in high-risk groups (such as those with hypertension or diabetes) is highly cost-effective. However, for over 55s without additional risk factors, the prevalence of CKD with proteinuria was too low for testing to be cost-effective. Although specific evidence for drug-induced nephrotoxicity was not considered, the GDG noted that both acute and chronic use of drugs known to be potentially nephrotoxic can lead to CKD. The use of certain agents such as lithium and calcineurin inhibitors should be monitored and the GDG considered that long-term chronic use of NSAIDs should prompt an annual GFR check. Further information can be obtained in the BNF. The GDG did not consider the evidence about smoking, alcohol intake, abnormal lipids, obesity (in the absence of metabolic syndrome), lower socioeconomic status and ethnicity strong enough to recommend that people in these groups should be tested for CKD."
"CG73S8","Classification and early identification","Acute kidney injury, diabetes, glomerular disease and hypertension as risk factors for CKD 
","The 2 major causes of CKD are diabetes and hypertension and the prevalence of CKD in the population rises with age. In many people with CKD the cause is uncertain and both diabetes and/or hypertension may co-exist with CKD together with the primary cause. There is a complex relationship between hypertension and kidney disease, hypertension may develop as a complication of CKD accelerate progression. In UK renal registry data123 13 diabetes remains the biggest documented cause of end stage kidney failure (Table 29). 
","The GDG agreed that progression of CKD (measured by change in eGFR and occurrence of end stage renal disease), mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular) and cardiovascular events were critical to decision making. Hospitalisation was also considered as important. However, no information was available for cardiovascular events or hospitalisation. 
There was evidence from an IPD meta-analysis that people with CKD and diabetes are at increased risk of mortality compared to those without diabetes irrespective of eGFR. The effect on progression of CKD was suggestive of an increased risk in people with diabetes, but the association was less clear. 
"
"CG73S9","Defining progression of CKD and the risk factors associated with progression","Defining progression","The Renal NSF adopted the US National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) classification of CKD.35 Whilst the beauty of this classification is its simplicity, this is also its weakness. The clinical features and course of CKD are dependent on a number of factors including the underlying cause, severity and associated conditions of the underlying cause.
Although the classification of CKD into 5 stages has been widely adopted, it has been criticised as not being sufficiently sophisticated for clinical needs. The existing classification is neither staged according to age, nor according to level of proteinuria. All patients, regardless of age, gender and proteinuria/albuminuria are considered to have at least moderately severe CKD when their GFR is <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. This guideline recommends that stage 3 should be subdivided into 3A and 3B, and that the suffix ‘(p)’ in parenthesis be adopted in the different stages to underline the importance of proteinuria/albuminuria as an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes (Table 6.1).
A further criticism of the existing classification of CKD has been the suggestion that loss of GFR is a feature of ageing and that many people classified as stage 3 CKD are merely exhibiting a normal ageing process. The effects of normal ageing on renal function are controversial. Data from some studies suggest that the decline in GFR with increasing age may be largely attributable to comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure. Loss of renal function may not, therefore, be an inevitable consequence of ageing.158–160 This was supported by studies demonstrating no or very little decline in GFR in the older population with longitudinal follow-up. The focus of defining progression of CKD in this section was to consider what constitutes progression in terms of rate of decline of GFR in order to provide clear guidance to clinicians. However, controversy over what constitutes normality in the group with the highest prevalence of CKD makes defining what constitutes progression even more difficult. Consideration must also be given to the inherent biological and analytical variation associated with estimation of GFR from serum creatinine measurements.","The GDG agreed that the evidence regarding the relationship between adverse outcomes and levels of GFR should be used as the basis of defining CKD but noted that the management and prognosis in people with a reduced but stable GFR may be quite different to that in people with a progressive decline in GFR. Hence the consideration of the evidence centered on a review of whether there is a decline in GFR and whether the decline was always the result of kidney disease or whether there was a ‘natural’ decline as a function of ageing and if so what level of decline should be considered normal.
The longitudinal studies contained mixed populations in that not all participants were followed up for the full duration of the study.
The lower kidney function described in one study of older people may be due to unrecognised kidney disease. However, there appears to be a small ‘natural’ age related decline in kidney function. Nevertheless it was recommended that the interpretation of GFR measurements should not normally be affected by the age of the person and that a low value should prompt the same response regardless of age.
The GDG agreed that a decline in GFR of more than 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year was more than could be accounted for by ageing alone.
The GDG recommended that, when interpreting the rate of decline of eGFR, it was also necessary to consider the baseline level of kidney function and the likelihood that kidney function would reach a level where renal replacement therapy would be needed if the rate of decline was maintained. For example, a rate of decline of 3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year would be of greater concern in a person with a baseline eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 aged 40 than in a person aged 70 with a baseline eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
When assessing the rate of decline in eGFR, the GDG agreed that a minimum of 3 measurements in not less than 90 days was required (depending on the initial level of eGFR). If a large and unexplained fall in GFR was observed, more frequent monitoring would be needed. Changes in GFR must be interpreted in light of the evidence on biological and assay variability in serum creatinine measurements, which is estimated at 5%. A calculation based on this would suggest that a decline in eGFR of 10 ml/min/1.73m2 per year would carry a 95% probability of significance. However, given that a decline in eGFR of more than 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year was more than could be accounted for by ageing alone the GDG agreed to define progression as either a decline in eGFR of >5 ml/min/1.73m2 within 1 year or a decline of >10 ml/min/1.73m2 within 5 years.
There was evidence from an IPD meta-analysis that people with CKD and diabetes are at increased risk of mortality compared to those without diabetes irrespective of eGFR. The effect on progression of CKD was suggestive of an increased risk in people with diabetes, but the association was less clear. 
The only available evidence for glomerular disease compared progression in different histological types of primary glomerulonephritis. Evidence suggested that membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranoproliferative glomerulosclerosis were all associated with a sequentially increased risk of end stage renal disease or dialysis than minimal change disease (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis carried the greatest risk). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was associated with a greater risk of end stage renal disease than IgA nephropathy. However, the increased risk of all-cause mortality was only greater in membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The GDG agreed a recommendation could not be based on this evidence alone, although it did suggest that type of glomerular disease could influence CKD progression. The objective of this review was to determine whether adverse outcomes are 
different in people with CKD and AKI (or history of AKI) compared to those without AKI. However, there was overlap with another question to determine whether an episode of AKI affects progression of CKD. The evidence reviewed included a mixture of comparisons. One compared two types of AKI, CKD and a control group,12 one compared people with CKD to different stages of AKI313
 and another compared people with and without prior CKD with or without AKI.425 The study which most directly met the review question, did not present sufficient data for analyses.207
However, the included studies did indicate that AKI increases risk of CKD progression, at all levels of eGFR. The GDG discussed that current practice was to treat people who recover from AKI as normal and not at increased risk of CKD, but evidence from this review suggests that this is not the case. In light of this evidence the GDG agreed that recommendation R25 from CG73 should include AKI in the list of risk factors that indicate testing for CKD be considered when the other AKI review was considered. The GDG also agreed that it was important to draft a recommendation to highlight 
that cause of CKD should be investigated following diagnosis. This was particularly important with a view to identifying possible treatable causes of CKD.

"CG73S10","Defining progression of CKD and the risk factors associated with progression","Risk factors associated with progression of CKD","In the literature, progression of kidney disease has been variously defined as doubling of serum creatinine, declining GFR or creatinine clearance, increasing proteinuria/albuminuria, and progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT, dialysis or kidney transplantation) or end stage renal disease. The list of possible factors associated with progression does not consider how differences in access to healthcare and poverty may influence the initiation and progression of CKD. Specifically, neither early life influences governing foetal development and low birth weight nor childhood factors contributing to the emergence of hypertension and diabetes are considered here.
Whilst it is clear that CKD is common, and recently published studies suggest that its prevalence is increasing,22 it is also clear that many people with diagnosed CKD do not progress.11,12 Importantly, their risk of cardiovascular disease is massively increased compared to the general population. In those that do progress, the subsequent mortality and morbidity risks rise exponentially, as do the associated healthcare costs. A reduced GFR is also associated with a wide range of complications such as hypertension, anaemia, renal bone disease, malnutrition, neuropathy and reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to clarify exactly what factors are associated with CKD progression, and which are remediable or potentially modifiable, in order to intervene at the earliest possible stage and improve the associated adverse outcomes.

","The GDG accepted that there was extensive clinical evidence that hypertension, diabetes and the presence of proteinuria are well recognised risk factors for progression of CKD.
The GDG also accepted that nephrotoxic drugs may affect progression. Of particular concern are the possible acute and chronic effects of NSAIDs which are available without prescription. Acute use of NSAIDs can lead to an acute and usually reversible fall in GFR but chronic use at therapeutic doses could be associated with progression of CKD. The GDG considered that the Murray et al. study examining the effects of chronic use of NSAIDs had follow-up too short to allow meaningful conclusions to be drawn. It was recommended that if chronic use of NSAIDs was considered clinically necessary the effect on GFR should be monitored and the drugs should be stopped if there is evidence of progressive CKD.
The evidence about possible adverse effects of aspirin was felt to be confounded by the use of aspirin in patients with cardiovascular disease which is a known risk factor for progression of CKD.
The evidence on the effects of smoking and ethnicity on the risk of progression was not conclusive but was sufficiently suggestive to merit highlighting within a recommendation.
The evidence on the effects of obesity on the risk of progression was unconvincing and did not require highlighting within a recommendation.
Despite the lack of evidence for urinary outflow tract obstruction for progression of CKD, the GDG consensus was that obstruction to outflow would lead to progression of CKD. Therefore it was agreed that urinary outflow tract obstruction should be considered as a risk factor.

"CG73S11","Other complications of chronic kidney disease","Bone Metabolism and Osteoporosis 
","Alterations in the control mechanisms for calcium and phosphate homeostasis occur early in the course of CKD and progress as kidney function decreases. Changes that occur include abnormalities of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D metabolism; together with abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralisation, volume, linear growth, and strength; plus vascular or soft tissue calcification.245 A wide variety of disturbances of bone metabolism may occur in the setting of CKD necessitating an understanding of the changes that occur in order to design a  treatment strategy. However, an in-depthdiscussion of metabolic bone disease in CKD is beyond the  scope of this guideline. This section is focussed on the changes that occur early in the course of CKD. The aim is to prevent metabolic bone disease by maintaining the blood levels of calcium and phosphate as close to normal as possible, and preventing the development of established  hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid hyperplasia. Central to the prevention of these disturbances is an ability to intervene early, recognising that bone disease in people with kidney disease is often asymptomatic, and symptoms appear only late in its course, long after the gold standard for assessment of metabolic bone disease it is neither widely available nor widely used. Biochemical assessment is the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment. In addition to  measurements of calcium and phosphate it is essential to obtain a direct index of parathyroid activity  by measurement of PTH. Under certain circumstances measurement of vitamin D may also be necessary. When should these parameters be measured and at what frequency should they be  repeated?","The GDG noted that in many of the studies the results were not broken down by stage of CKD or level of GFR. Although there were statistically significant differences in mean calcium concentrations at different levels of GFR these were unlikely to be clinically significant differences. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum calcium concentrations in  people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with  stage 3B CKD. The GDG noted that although there were statistically significant differences in mean phosphateconcentrations at different levels of GFR these values were all within the normal range. Serum phosphate concentrations generally fell within the normal range unless the GFR level was below 20 ml/min/1.73 m2. 12 On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum phosphate concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD.  The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in people with a reduced GFR was higher than in healthy  individuals; however, the significance of modestly elevated PTH concentrations was thought unclear and there was no consensus on whether people with concentrations elevated to this extent benefit from treatment. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no requirement to routinely measure serum PTH concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD in absence of specific indications. 
Specific indications to measure serum PTH would include unexplained hypercalcaemia and symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. 
Most laboratories do not measure 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. On the basis of the evidence the GDG agreed that there was no need to routinely measure serum vitamin D concentrations in people with stage 1, 2 and 3A CKD and that it was not usually necessary to measure it in people with stage 3B CKD except where there are specific indications such as unexplained hypocalcaemia or symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency.  Because of the increased prevalence of abnormal serum calcium, phosphate, PTH and vitamin D concentrations in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD and the fact that these people may require 
treatment for renal bone disease it was recommended that calcium, phosphate and PTH concentrations should be measured in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD. There was no evidence to guide a recommendation about how frequently the calcium, phosphate, PTH and vitamin D concentrations should be measured in people with stage 4 and 5 CKD and the GDG agreed that this would be determined by the clinical circumstances.

"CG73S12","Other complications of chronic kidney disease","Risks and benefits of bisphosphonates for preventing osteoporosis in adults with CKD ","Osteoporosis is caused by the cumulative effect of bone resorption in excess of bone formation.  Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption with relatively few side effects and are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can also develop in people with CKD and ESRD for many reasons beyond age-related bone loss and postmenopausal bone loss. People with CKD are far more likely than the general population to have conditions putting them at risk of osteoporosis and are much more likely to be prescribed medication promoting development of osteoporosis. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in people with advanced CKD is not as straightforward as it is in people with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Neither fragility fractures nor the World Health Organization bone mineral density criteria can be used to diagnose osteoporosis in this population since all forms of renal bone disease may fracture or have low ‘T scores’. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in people with CKD must be done by first excluding the other forms of renal osteodystrophy.256 33 Bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed orally (1–5% of an oral dose), and absorption is best when the drug is given on an empty stomach. Approximately 80% of the absorbed bisphosphonate is usually cleared by the kidney, the remaining 20% being taken up by bone. Relative bone uptake is increased in conditions of high bone turnover, with less of the drug being excreted by the kidneys. The plasma half-life is approximately one hour, while the bisphosphonate may persist in bone for the lifetime of the patient. ","The GDG concluded that from the studies presented there was no evidence of an increased risk of drug related adverse events in people with CKD. Bisphosphonates appeared to have benefits on bone mineral density in people with CKD. The studies did not include people with a GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2and therefore there is no evidence about either the effectiveness or the safety of bisphosphonates in this group. Guidelines on the management of osteoporosis do not make recommendations that relate to people with CKD. The dose of bisphosphonate may need adjusting according to the GFR and clinicians should refer to  the drugs’ Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for guidance on this.

Dapagliflozin is currently being studied as a triple therapy add-on to 2 other oral agents and, in the absence of any other currently available clinical-effectiveness data, the manufacturers provided a post hoc analysis of pooled data from a subset of older patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease recruited in 2 trials of dapagliflozin as an add-on to metformin and sulfonylurea. The Committee concluded that significant caution should be taken when interpreting the results of these preliminary analyses. 
The Committee discussed the outcomes collected in the clinical trials and network meta-analyses, noting that the primary outcomes were intermediate rather than clinical outcomes and that these were collected over a relatively short follow-up
The Committee concluded that, despite some uncertainty about the impact of HbA1c reduction on longer-term macrovascular complications, it was prepared to accept the link between intermediate outcomes collected in the clinical trials and longer-term clinical outcomes. 
The Committee concluded that, on the basis of the results of the network meta-analyses, dapagliflozin in dual therapy as add-on to metformin appeared to provide similar glycaemic control to other antidiabetic drugs but may result in greater weight loss. 
The Committee concluded that, on the basis of the results of the network meta-analyses, dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to insulin appeared to have greater efficacy than DPP-4 inhibitors for the outcome of weight loss and similar efficacy for HbA1c reduction.

"TA288S4","Evidence for Cost Effectiveness","Evidence for Cost Effectiveness","Availability, nature and quality of evidence 
","The manufacturers had provided a revised economic model in order to address concerns raised by the DSU about the original model and the DSU considered that their concerns had been addressed. However, the DSU and the ERG had identified a number of errors in the revised model which were subsequently addressed by the DSU in its exploratory analyses. The Committee concluded that the manufacturers' revised economic model with the subsequent amendments made by the DSU was acceptable for assessing the cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes. 
The Committee concluded that the results of the validation exercise with the CORE diabetes model provided reassurance about the integrity of the results obtained from the manufacturers' revised economic model. 
In terms of the clinical-effectiveness data that were applied in the economic models, the Committee considered that it was more appropriate to use a single source as was available in the 52-week network meta analysis, but was aware of the limited number of trials informing this analysis. It also noted that the 24-week network meta-analysis only excluded sulfonylureas, and that the evidence from the 
clinical specialists suggested that dapagliflozin would be used where a sulfonylurea was not appropriate. On this basis the 24-week network meta-analysis data were appropriate. 
The Committee heard from the DSU that the results from the revised model were sensitive to the timing of treatment switching in the model which was dependent on the relationship between HbA1c at the start of treatment, treatment-related changes in HbA1c levels and the HbA1c threshold levels for switching treatment
The Committee considered that uncertainty remained about the effects of stopping treatment with dapagliflozin and the impact on weight gain. Therefore, it concluded that the scenario analysis conducted by the DSU, which involved the convergence of differences in weight profiles between treatment groups at the time of switching to the last line of treatment, was more appropriate for decision-making. 
The Committee considered the utility values applied in the model, noting that the majority of the QALY gains associated with dapagliflozin arose from the direct impact of weight change on health-related quality of life rather than a reduction of diabetic complications and other adverse events. The Committee concluded that the utility values associated with changes in weight may have been too large and that the 
values applied in the manufacturers' scenario analyses and DSU analyses were more reasonable. 
The Committee noted that the DSU had completed analyses that included both the higher and lower estimates of loss of utility associated with hypoglycaemic events, and that these had made small differences to the estimates of the ICER. 
The Committee concluded that, although the loss in utility associated with urinary tract and genital infections was likely to be greater than that proposed by the manufacturers, it was satisfied that this did not significantly impact on the relative cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin as dual therapy or add-on to insulin
The Committee noted that in all settings the majority of the QALY gains associated with dapagliflozin arose from the direct impact of weight change on health-related quality of life rather than from a reduction of diabetic complications and other adverse events. For dapagliflozin as dual therapy in combination 
with metformin, the Committee considered the DSU deterministic analysis and scenario analyses, which included the convergence of differences in weight between treatment groups at the time of switching to the last line of treatment. It noted that these showed that DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with higher costs and QALYs than dapagliflozin, but that these differences were small. It noted further that in the DSU probabilistic sensitivity analysis these differences were even smaller. 
For dapagliflozin as add-on to insulin, the Committee noted that in all the analyses conducted by the DSU the estimate of the ICER. for dapagliflozin compared with DPP-4 inhibitors was below £20,000 per QALY. 
The Committee concluded that its 
recommendations would not have a particular 
impact on any of the groups whose interests are protected by the equalities legislation and that there was no need to alter or add to its recommendations.

"CG87S1.1","Patient Education","Patient Education","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive long-term medical condition that is predominantly
managed by the person with the diabetes and/or their carer as part of their daily life. Accordingly,
understanding of diabetes, informed choice of management opportunities, and the acquisition of
relevant skills for successful self-management play an important role in achieving optimal
outcomes. Delivery of these needs is not always assured by conventional clinical consultations.
Structured programmes have been designed not only to improve people’s knowledge and skills,
but also to help motivate and sustain people with diabetes in taking control of their condition and
in delivering effective self-management.","The GDG noted that the last review of this area by a HTA on behalf of NICE in 2003 looked at the evidence for structured education. Little robust evidence of the effectiveness of any particular educational approach for people with Type 2 diabetes was found. One conclusion was that further research was required, but meanwhile that educational programmes with a theoretical basis demonstrated improved outcomes, and that group education was a more effective use of resources and may have additional benefits.

"CG87S1.6.1","DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin) 
","DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin) ","Human GLP-1 has an extremely short half-life in the body. Dipeptidyl  peptidase-4 breaks down GLP-1, so inhibiting this enzyme prolongs the activity of GLP-1. DPP-4 inhibitors are taken orally and, in general, are not associated with weight loss. 

","The GDG discussed how DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin) should be used in the pathway of care, and how to identify those people or groups of people with the greatest potential to benefit. 
Overall, the GDG agreed that DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin and vildagliptin) were appropriate options for use in dual therapy. (See also the considerations concerning cost effectiveness in section 2.7.2.) Recommendations were also made on the use of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin48 in triple therapy specifically when insulin use was considered inappropriate or was unacceptable to the person with diabetes. The GDG considered it appropriate to define a beneficial metabolic response for continuation of these agents. The choice of at least 0.5 percentage point reduction in HbA1c at 6 months, although not based in evidence, was agreed as a clinically important response from a starting level of 7.5% HbA1c or less; however, the GDG acknowledged that many patients will start a DPP-4 inhibitor at higher levels of HbA1c. Prescribers should be aware, as with all biochemical results, that measurement variability exists, and any test results should be interpreted in this light. There is also a need to ensure, in the absence of long-term safety data, that people do not remain on medications that do not produce the anticipated benefits. This would also ensure that HbA1c levels do not remain inadequately controlled for long periods.

drugs may be taken in combination with other oral agents or, in the case of 
pioglitazone, with insulin. They work by increasing the body’s sensitivity to 
insulin. These drugs rarely cause hypoglycaemia, but commonly cause weight 
gain. They are associated with fluid retention (including peripheral oedema) 
and distal bone fractures (in women only). 
","Overall, the GDG agreed that thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone) were appropriate options for use in dual therapy.  Recommendations were also made on the use of pioglitazone with insulin and the thiazolidinediones in triple therapy, specifically if insulin use was  considered inappropriate or was unacceptable to the person with diabetes. As for the DPP-4 inhibitors, the GDG considered it appropriate to define a  beneficial metabolic response for continuation of these agents. The same  rationale applies for the definition of the metabolic response (that is, at least a  0.5 percentage point reduction in HbA1c at 6 months with a starting level of  6.5% or 7.5% – a higher intervention level may be agreed with the individual).  The GDG acknowledged that there were more data on safety for the thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone ) than for the DPP-4 ,inhibitors (sitagliptin and vildagliptin), with evidence showing risks associated  with both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. The continuation criterion aims to ensure that people do not remain for long periods on medication that is ineffective at controlling their HbA1c levels"

emptying. Patients must inject exenatide twice daily. 
","The GDG discussed how a GLP-1 mimetic (exenatide) should be used in the  pathway of care, and how to identify those people or groups of people with the greatest potential to benefit.  Overall, the GDG agreed that a GLP-1 mimetic (exenatide) was not an  appropriate option for use in second-line therapy. (See also considerations concerning cost effectiveness in section 2.7.2.)

"CG87S1.6.4","Long-acting human insulin analogues","Long-acting human insulin analogues","Insulin detemir and insulin glargine are long-acting human insulin analogues.  They are prepared by modifying human insulin to change its solubility. This  allows slow release into the bloodstream from subcutaneous tissue and a  longer duration of action, which more closely mimics natural basal insulin secretion.  Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine are administered via subcutaneous  injection and are licensed for use with oral glucose-lowering agents. 
","The GDG discussed how long-acting insulin analogues should be used in the  pathway of care, and how to identify those people or groups of people with the ngreatest potential to benefit.  In NICE clinical guideline 66, NPH insulin was recommended as the  ‘preferable’ choice of the initial insulin; however, based on the new cost  effectiveness modelling, the GDG considered that this recommendation  should be clarified, and should recommend that NPH insulin should be used nas the initial insulin. (See also considerations concerning cost effectiveness in section 2.7.2.) The GDG also considered that there were situations in which  the use of insulin glargine or insulin detemir could be recommended only after a trial of NPH insulin; recommendations were made on their use in subgroups with the greatest potential to benefit, based on clinical judgement.

"CG87S1.6.5","Cost effectiveness","Cost effectiveness","The Assessment Group undertook a systematic review of relevant cost and 
cost-effectiveness studies. The review also considered evidence published in 
abstracts. The majority of the studies identified by the Assessment Group 
were not UK based, and many were sponsored by drug manufacturers. 
Unless otherwise stated, the following summary focuses on full economic 
evaluations undertaken from a UK perspective.","The GDG recognised the many strengths but also the limitations of using the  UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model as a basis for  modelling because it predicts only the first event in any single category of  diabetes-related complications. In addition, not all relevant complications are included in the model (for example, peripheral neuropathy is excluded). Moreover, there was concern that the UKPDS may fail to adequately capture the impact of weight changes on health-related quality of life, or diabetic complications that occur infrequently. The GDG acknowledged that measures of adiposity may not independently increase the risk of some diabetic complications. Given these limitations, the analysis developed by the Assessment Group attempted to take into account potential direct quality of life gains associated with weight changes and the reduced fear of hypoglycaemic episodes. The Assessment Group also attempted to explore the impact of changing the baseline rate of complications.

"CG173S1","Care process and support","Key Principles of Care","There was no specific review question regarding the key principles of care. The GDG agreed that elements of care other than pharmacological 
treatments, such as the person’s experience, their information needs, 
individual preferences and different lifestyle factors, are also important 
to be considered in a person’s care pathway. 

However, the GDG agreed that patient care is particularly important in the 
treatment of neuropathic pain. The GDG decided that this should be further 
discussed to make recommendations for good principles of care based on 
informal consensus.
"," No evidence was considered in this section and therefore 
there were no evidence statements. The recommendations were based on the 
expertise and experience of the GDG. "
"CG173S2","Treatment","All neuropathic pain (except trigeminal neuralgia) 
","When it had reviewed evidence for peripheral neuropathic pain (see 
section 3.2) and central neuropathic pain (see section 3.3), the GDG 
concluded it was most appropriate to provide a single set of 
recommendations for all forms of neuropathic pain (except trigeminal 
neuralgia), based on the overall analysis combining all types of pain. 
The reasons for not providing separate recommendations for 
peripheral and central pain are provided in sections 3.2.4 and 3.3.4 
respectively. 
","As a result of the low-quality evidence (and high uncertainty of the  results from the analyses referred to above), the GDG relied heavily  on their experience and clinical opinion when making  recommendations. The GDG also stated that better-quality research  was needed (please see research recommendations).  The GDG also advised that combination therapies should be further  explored, because the effect of adding a treatment onto another  treatment may be more practical and effective than switching to a new  treatment. The GDG also considered that the use of combination 
therapies could potentially reduce side effects of particular  pharmacological agents through using a combination of lower  dosages. However, current evidence is not sufficient to warrant any  recommendation on combination therapies. As a result, the GDG  recommended further research into combination therapies (please see 
research recommendations). 
The GDG discussed concerns that had been raised about people 
becoming dependent on drugs such as gabapentin and pregabalin. 
The GDG was not aware of any such issues, either in their clinical 
experience or in the evidence included in the guideline. The GDG 
further agreed that the potential for dependency was not limited to Neuropathic pain – pharmacological management: NICE clinical guideline 173 (November
2013) Page 69 of 138 these drugs and is associated with a number of drugs, including 
opioids. The GDG was also concerned that people with a history of maddiction or drug dependency could possibly be denied effective mdrugs. Based on this concern and the lack of evidence in the area, the mGDG could not make a specific recommendation about the potential  for dependency with certain drugs, but felt that the issue could be 
explored when assessing the risks and benefits for the individual 
person. NICE highlighted the following issues:  ? The uncertainty of the clinical evidence of efficacy included within  the guideline and the consequent low reliability of the health 
economic model.  ? The requirement for the guideline to cover all types of neuropathic 
pain by a licensed or best available treatment.  ? The recommendation of an off-label preparation above a licensed  preparation based on cost alone but in the absence of clear evidence of greater clinical efficacy in the outcomes identified as 
critical by the GDG. 
These issues have led NICE to the decision that we are unable to  endorse a recommendation for an off-label pharmacological  preparation ahead of a licensed pharmacological preparation in the  absence of strong clinical evidence. For this reason, recommendation  1.1.8 includes duloxetine and pregabalin as initial treatment options 
for neuropathic pain alongside amitriptyline and gabapentin. 
 
Nortriptyline is no longer recommended in the guideline. "
"CG173S3","Treatment","Trigeminal neuralgia ","The GDG was concerned by the lack of robust evidence on trigeminal 
neuralgia but recognised that carbamazepine is the only drug currently 
licensed for this condition and it is widely used in current practice. The 
GDG was aware of other very poor quality studies on different off-label 
drugs for trigeminal neuralgia (which did not meet the inclusion criteria 
specified in the review protocol), such as oxcarbazepine or 
lacosamide, which could potentially have less side effects or be better 
tolerated than carbamazepine. However, in the absence of robust, 
good-quality evidence, the GDG felt unable to recommend the use of 
these off-label drugs. 
The GDG discussed the disabling nature of trigeminal neuralgia and 
the importance of making recommendations on its treatment. The 
GDG also agreed the importance of speed in starting treatment in 
order to prevent unnecessary suffering. 
The GDG decided that making recommendations based on the 
evidence from ‘all neuropathic pain’ would be inappropriate. The GDG 
viewed this condition to be particularly distinctive from other 
neuropathic pain conditions and felt that, based on their clinical 
experience, recommending anything other than treatment used in 
current practice (that is, carbamazepine) for trigeminal neuralgia 
would not be appropriate.","Because of the disabling nature of the condition, the GDG also further 
considered the urgency of offering treatment and referring patients 
with trigeminal neuralgia to specialist pain services if the pain does not 
respond to carbamazepine, or if carbamazepine is not tolerated or is 
contraindicated. The GDG felt that pain specialists would have more 
experience in treating this specific group of patients. 
The group agreed that part of the reason why it may be difficult to 
conduct research in this area is that most patients in the UK with 
trigeminal neuralgia are already on carbamazepine and do not wish to 
risk not receiving the drug. The GDG also felt that, in the absence of 
robust evidence, this may show that there is at least some efficacy of 
this drug over no treatment for these patients. Consequently, despite 
the paucity of robust evidence and because treatment with 
carbamazepine is current practice, the GDG wanted to make a strong Neuropathic pain – pharmacological management: NICE clinical guideline 173 (November
2013) Page 92 of 138
recommendation for carbamazepine. The GDG decided that there was 
insufficient evidence to make a recommendation to change current 
practice. 
However, despite its widespread use, the GDG urged that robust 
research to be undertaken into the clinical and cost effectiveness of 
carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia. The GDG also felt that it 
should strongly encourage that robust research to be done into the 
clinical and cost-effectiveness for alternative treatments for trigeminal 
neuralgia. 
As with initial treatment with carbamazepine, the GDG felt that 
expedient treatment should be a priority. Switching pain medications 
to the treatments recommended for ‘all neuropathic pain’ should be 
considered while patients are waiting referral to a specialist pain 
management service, so at least some intervention is attempted to 
alleviate the pain during this period"

BMS have already been described in Section 2 as part of existing practice. The rest of this section is devoted to methods of reducing restenosis and, in particular, to the use of DES as a means of achieving this","The Committee reviewed the evidence available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of PCIs using a BMS and DES, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition
and the value placed by users on the benefits of BMS and DES from clinical experts and those who represent patients with angina. It was also mindful of the need to ensure that
its advice took account of the efficient use of NHS resources The Assessment Report presents three sets of comparison: PCI without stents versus PCI with BMS; PCI with BMS versusCABG; and BMS versus DES.
Assessment of the relative clinical effectiveness of stents considers the likelihood of restenosis discovered on follow-up and the requirement for repeat intervention
(revascularisation). Repeat intervention may occur: 
(i) because of a requirement of the trial protocol, specifyinga repeat angiographic examination at a predeterminedinterval (so-called ‘protocol-driven’ reintervention); or 
(ii) following a recurrence of symptomatic angina in thepatient (that is, ‘clinically-driven’ reintervention). Thefrequency of protocol-driven reinterventions is higher thanthat of clinically driven reinterventions, because angiography is usually mandatory at 6 months in the trial protocolwhereas in clinical practice it is carried out only after
recurrence of symptoms. Accordingly, the absolute differences observed between the treatment and control arms of clinical trials are likely to be higher than would be
expected to occur in clinical practice."
"TA71S02","Cost Effectiveness","Cost Effectiveness","","The financial impact of using DES depends on the proportion of stented arteries that are narrow or contain long lesions offset against the increased capacity of the system resulting
from a decrease in procedures to manage restenosis. Although the total number of aterties requiring a DES in the UK is unknown, it could be as high as one-third of all stents.
Based on this proportion, the additional cost of DES without offsets would be between £6 and £7.2 million per year, assuming the use of about12,000 DES stents costing an
additional £500 to £600 each. If the use of drug eluting stents reduced the restenosis rate by about 10 percentage points then the additional capacity generated could be used to increase the number of new stent procedures. This would have the effect of offsettingthe cost of the BMS by about £4 million per year. Such cost savings, however, will often only be realised in the form of additional capacity."

","The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of DESs, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition and the value placed on the benefits of DESs by people with coronary artery disease, those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It was also mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.2 The Committee considered the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of DESs in the treatment of CHD. The Committee acknowledged that the clinical trials showed that the use of any type DESs reduced the rate of revascularisation in the target lesions and the target vessels, at all follow-up time points up to 3 years, compared with any-type BMSs. The Committee noted not just the trial data, but also the recent discussions on the effects of DESs on the risks of thrombosis, MI, and mortality, and accepted the findings of the FDA review that any-type DESs conferred no statistically significant benefits in mortality or acute MI rates over any-type BMSs. The Committee concluded that the key benefit of 
DESs is the reduction in rates of revascularisation in target lesions and target vessels compared with BMSs. 4.3.3 The Committee considered whether there was any evidence to suggest that there were differences in the clinical effectiveness of the various types of DESs.

"TA152S02","Cost Effectiveness","Cost Effectiveness","","In considering the cost effectiveness of DESs compared with BMSs, the Committee noted that the model structure used by the Assessment Group was appropriate. The Committee discussed the key parameters that drove the Assessment Group’s economic model. It considered the absolute rate of revascularisation of BMSs in the total population of stented patients and noted that the Assessment Group used 7.43% for patients in its base case in the assessment report. The Committee heard testimony from the clinical specialists that the rate of revascularisation of BMSs was around 12% in the published literature. It noted that some of these published trials included protocol-driven angiography and revascularisationand therefore were likely to be an overestimate of actual revascularisation rates in clinical practice in the UK. The Committee noted that the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data revascularisation rates were lower than those from other data sets including the BASKET trial (11%), which had not included protocol-driven angiography, and the Scottish Registry (11.5%). 
The Committee discussed the range of possible values for revascularisation and their relevance to UK practice and concluded that a rate of 11% for the absolute rate of revascularisation was a reasonable estimate for UK practice. The Committee agreed that DESs could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources at a price difference of £600. After considering the alternative parameter values presented by the Assessment Group and BCIS, the Committee concluded that on balance at a price difference between DESs and BMSs of not more than £300, DESs could be considered a cost effective option in patients with small vessels and long lesions, and should be recommended for use in these patient groups. The Committee's decision was based on a price difference of £300 between BMSs and DESs. The Committee noted that procurement arrangements for DESs at a price difference of £300 was already in place within many NHS regions and achievable across the NHS as a whole. The Committee understood that the mean absolute price of a BMS, to the NHS, was £131.

"IPG489S1","Efficacy and safety","","Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder in which the stomach empties more slowly than normal (delayed gastric emptying) in the absence of any type of mechanical obstruction. The most common symptoms are nausea and protracted vomiting. Other symptoms include abdominal bloating, and, in severe cases, malnutrition. Gastroparesis most commonly occurs in people with type 1 diabetes. It can also occur in other situations such as after abdominal surgery or in association with anorexia nervosa and abdominal migraine. Some cases are idiopathic. Conservative treatment options include modification of dietary intake and medical therapy with antiemetics or prokinetics. Treatment options for chronic intractable (drug-refractory) symptoms include jejunostomy tube insertion for feeding, gastrostomy tube insertion for stomach decompression, and pyloroplasty. Gastroelectrical stimulation is an option for treating chronic, intractable nausea and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis.  Electrical stimulation is delivered via an implanted system that consists of a neurostimulator and 2 leads. Implantation is done with the patient under general anaesthesia by an open or laparoscopic approach. The stimulating electrode of each intramuscular lead is fixed to the muscle of the distal part of the stomach. The connector end of each lead is then attached to the neurostimulator, which is placed in a pocket in the abdominal wall. When the neurostimulator is turned on, electrical impulses are delivered. The rate and amplitude of stimulation can be adjusted wirelessly with a hand-held external programmer. Patients may need to return to hospital for adjustment or reprogramming of the device, to optimise the effect on gastric emptying.                              ","The Committee concluded that the evidence of efficacy was adequate only after prolonged debate about the design of the available randomised trials. The trials included an initial phase before randomisation in which the device was left 'on'. There was concern that any beneficial effect of the device might therefore have been carried over into the control period, so reducing the symptoms in that phase of the trial. The Committee also noted the possibility of a placebo response. The Committee recognised that gastroparesis can be a very debilitating condition with very few treatment options, and it noted patient commentaries describing substantial improvements in quality of life with gastroelectrical stimulation."
